            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T were as eaſy for me to doe, as any thing that I know, to ſhew my reader what a deale of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe is done by <hi>Miſtakes</hi> and <hi>Prejudices:</hi> how many <hi>godly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> and <hi>profitable deſignes</hi> are hindred by them. But becauſe I thinke it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les to goe ſo largly, I will take a narrower com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas, and confine my ſelfe to the naming only of ſome of thoſe miſtakes and prejudices which attend a godly life; the chiefe whereof my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour ſhall be in my enſuing diſcourſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move. They are ſuch as theſe: That there is a neceſſity of <hi>Monkery</hi> and <hi>beggery,</hi> becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>It is eaſier for a Camel to goe thorow the eye of a needle, then for a rich man to enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven.</hi> Math: 19.24. That there is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119702:4"/>of <hi>expoſing ones ſelfe to all manner of injuries,</hi> becauſe it is ſaid, that <hi>If a man ſmite me upon one cheek,</hi> I muſt <hi>give him the other.</hi> Math: 39. That there is a neceſſity of <hi>ſtarving with hunger &amp; cold,</hi> and <hi>periſhing for want,</hi> becauſe I muſt <hi>take no thought, what I ſhall eate, or what I ſhall drink, or wherewithall I ſhall be cloathed.</hi> Math: 6.31. That there is a neceſſity of <hi>denying my ſelfe neceſſary reſt and recreation,</hi> becauſe I muſt be continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>watching</hi> and <hi>praying.</hi> Mark 13.33. 1 Pet: 4.7. <hi>&amp;c,</hi> That there is a neceſſity of <hi>being mine own enemy,</hi> becauſe I muſt <hi>deny my ſelfe.</hi> Math: 16.24. That there is a neceſſity of <hi>caſting off naturall affection,</hi> becauſe I muſt <hi>hate father and mother, If I</hi> will be Chriſt's <hi>diſciple.</hi> Luke 14.26. That there is neceſſity of allowing <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>diſobedience</hi> to <hi>magiſtrates and parents,</hi> becauſe I muſt <hi>obey God rather then men.</hi> Acts 5.29. That there is a neceſſity of being <hi>ſtrange, and peeviſh</hi> and <hi>phrantique</hi> (and many other ſuch things, as <hi>unſuitable,</hi> and <hi>inconſiſtent,</hi> &amp; <hi>reproachfull,</hi> as they are thought to be <hi>requiſite</hi> and <hi>gracefull</hi> to the <hi>profeſſion of Chriſtianity</hi>) becauſe the <hi>hypocriticall</hi> ſort of profeſſors uſe to <hi>be</hi> ſo, and the <hi>honeſter</hi> are and have been many times <hi>counted</hi> ſo, (as that prophet was by <hi>Jehu</hi> 2 Kings 9.11: and the reſt of the prophets <hi>Jer:</hi> 29.26.) I could name you up a great many more miſtaks of the like nature, which like ſo many <hi>bugbeares,</hi> or <hi>lyons in the way,</hi> either do <hi>Indeed affright</hi> the <hi>Ignorant,</hi> who
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119702:4"/>know not what it is to be <hi>godly:</hi> or are uſed for <hi>pretences</hi> of feare by the <hi>ſlothfull</hi> and <hi>malicious,</hi> who are unwilling to travell, in the wildernes where people doe not uſe to travell, although they might have manna from heaven for meat, and water out of the rock for drink, which are helpes ſufficient to make the journey <hi>eaſy:</hi> and although it lead to the <hi>land of Canaan,</hi> where there is <hi>milk</hi> and <hi>honey</hi> enough to make ſufficient recompence, were the journey never ſo <hi>painfull.</hi> And indeed, I know not any thing that ſuffers ſo much from miſtake &amp; prejudice as a <hi>Godly life;</hi> and it were eaſy to make more complaints of this nature. But I will name only one more, that which I think does as much miſcheife as any, &amp; that which I ſhall endevour in this diſcourſe to remove, <hi>viz:</hi> A neceſſity of <hi>being ſad,</hi> and <hi>unſociable,</hi> and <hi>cynically malancholick,</hi> becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>Woe unto you that laugh</hi> Luk 6.25. And <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourne.</hi> Math: 5.4.</p>
            <p>Now of this neceſſity, <hi>Godlines</hi> hath ever had the luck, not only to be falſly accuſed, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly condemned by too too many. So that (pity it is to ſee it) thinking they ſhall meet with nothing but <hi>ſtormes</hi> and <hi>tempeſts,</hi> to <hi>diſquiet</hi> their <hi>heads</hi> with; nothing but <hi>rocks of offence,</hi> to break their hearts upon; nothing but <hi>gulfes</hi> of <hi>deſpaire,</hi> to ſwallow up their <hi>ſoules</hi> in: they reſolve a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times rather, to lye at anchor in the haven, and ſleep in a whole skin, and never put forth at
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119702:5"/>all, then upon ſuch termes.</p>
            <p>And no wonder. For doubtleſſe the thought of <hi>Sadneſſe,</hi> which is a thing moſt <hi>avoided</hi> of all, muſt needs have a very great power to <hi>affright</hi> and <hi>deterre;</hi> as the thought of <hi>Joy,</hi> which is the thing moſt deſired of all (being the <hi>fruit,</hi> &amp; <hi>end</hi> of all <hi>deſires</hi>) hath the greateſt power to <hi>entice</hi> and <hi>perſwade. Sorrow,</hi> and <hi>ſadneſſe,</hi> being <hi>againſt our natures,</hi> even as their cauſes are; we cannot chuſe but <hi>feare</hi> and <hi>ſhunne</hi> them, or whatſoever we think either may be a <hi>cauſe</hi> of <hi>them,</hi> or uſes to be <hi>attended</hi> with them.</p>
            <p>No wonder, I ſay, that men are ſo loath to venture upon a <hi>godly life,</hi> when their Judgments are foreſtald with <hi>feares</hi> of a <hi>ſad life.</hi> I can never be <hi>willing</hi> to <hi>doe</hi> that which will make me <hi>ſad:</hi> no more, then that which will make me ſad, can <hi>agree</hi> with my <hi>will:</hi> which if it did not <hi>diſagree</hi> with, I ſhould never be <hi>ſad.</hi> I can not poſſibly <hi>will</hi> now, to have that thing, which I know, when I have it, will make me <hi>will</hi> that I had it not. If there can be no <hi>Joy in</hi> the having, there may not be a will, or a <hi>deſire for</hi> the having; <hi>will,</hi> and <hi>deſire</hi> looking <hi>forwards,</hi> and <hi>Joy,</hi> and <hi>content</hi> look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing backward each of them upon the ſame object. Can I but make a man believe, he ſhall be <hi>merry,</hi> when, he hath done a thing, I ſhall not be long in making him <hi>willing</hi> to doe it. To be <hi>joyfull,</hi> 'tis <hi>life,</hi> and more: for it is the very <hi>life</hi> of life. If a life be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

            <p>My method therefore ſhall be this. Firſt I ſhall ſhew you the <hi>grounds,</hi> and <hi>cauſes</hi> of his mirth. Secondly I ſhall anſwer the maine <hi>objection</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Affliction.</hi> After that, I ſhall ſhew you the <hi>Nature</hi> of his <hi>mirth;</hi> when I ſhall tell you, that he hath not only <hi>better cauſes</hi> of mirth, then a <hi>wicked man,</hi> (whom you think to be the only man that <hi>lives a merry life</hi>) but <hi>better mirth,</hi> when he hath it.

            <p>Now the <hi>cauſes</hi> that a <hi>godly man</hi> hath to be joyfull, and the <hi>helps</hi> &amp; <hi>meanes</hi> he hath to make him merry, are either from the goodneſſe of the <hi>Condition</hi> in which he is, or the goodneſſe of the <hi>Conditions,</hi> and habits, and graces, which are in him.

What an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary comfort muſt it needs be, to have the enjoyment of ſuch good company, of which a man can never be <hi>depriv'd,</hi> nor be <hi>weary,</hi> nor ſo much as <hi>feare that he ſhall be!</hi> Such company God is. But you will ſay perhaps, this is but a phancy of yours, that a man can have joy in the <hi>company of God.</hi> For, if <hi>he goe down to Hell, he will find him there alſo.</hi> Pſal: 139.8. And upon what ground can I take delight in his countenance, who ſeeth all things? I anſwer, It is true indeed, It is poſſible, God may be with thee, &amp; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the while, he may not be <hi>with thee,</hi> but <hi>againſt thee.</hi> He might be preſent with thee, not as a companion, or a friend, to <hi>watch over thee,</hi> that no other thing may doe thee hurt: but as an obſerver, &amp; an enemy, to watch for; &amp; ſpy thy faults to doe thee hurt himſelfe. But if he be <hi>preſent</hi> with thee indeèd, ſo as thou art al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo preſent with him, (which can hardly be ſaid of <hi>a wicked man</hi>) and if thou art not only under the <hi>ſight</hi> of his <hi>Countenance,</hi> ſo as to be ſeen by him; but alſo in the <hi>light</hi> of his <hi>Countenance</hi> too, ſo as to ſee him againe, and enjoy communion and fellowſhip with him, through his ſpirit; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely if any condition in the world will make thee <hi>merry,</hi> this will. <hi>Job,</hi> when he ſpeakes of the comfortable condition, of a man that God hath delivered from going down into the pit from his

            <p>Well, you ſee by this time, what <hi>good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany</hi> a godly man alwaies hath to converſe with: even no worſe then the <hi>eternall Trinity,</hi> and the <hi>immortall Angells;</hi> ſuch company as he enjoyes moſt, when the world thinks he is alone. I might have mentioned the <hi>company of Saints alſo,</hi> (exceeding comfortable company: eſpecially at ſuch time as they meet together, either for the <hi>worſhip</hi> of God; or for holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and communicating to one another their experiences of the love of God.) But, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the greateſt part of his life, he is without it; I had rather, he ſhould make his boaſt of the other; which unleſſe by his own default, he may alwaies enjoy, and there is nothing that can deprive him of it. Now if a man have ſuch <hi>company,</hi> and yet cannot be <hi>merry;</hi> I will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it to the <hi>highth</hi> of his <hi>folly,</hi> and <hi>negligence</hi> in improving his priviledges; rather then to the <hi>depth</hi> of his <hi>melancholy,</hi> as if he had no remedy ſufficient to remove it. For my part (and I wonder no more are of my mind.) I can at no time think of the godly man's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition upon this account, but preſently, I admire his unſpeakable happineſſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. If a<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal: 4.4.</note> Heathen were able to ſay,<note place="margin">Scipio.</note> he was <hi>never leſſe alone,</hi> then when he was alone: how much more he?

When the night comes, and all other company leaves him; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made peace with God, and his conſcience, he quietly betakes himſelfe to his bed, troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himſelfe with nothing, &amp; having nothing to trouble him. Whereas the wicked man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forced thither by want of opportunity, or ſtrength, or ſome other meanes of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing wickedneſſe, ſeldome gets into it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either fretting and vexing himſelfe, or being vexed with one thing or other. Either he is ſick in his body with paine, having fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his pleaſures too much: or he is ſick in his mind with ſorrow, for having had none, or not ſo much as he would. It is ſeldome that a wicked man goes to bed, without having done himſelfe, or his neighbour ſome hurt, one way or other: either of which is enough to make him <hi>vexe</hi> and be <hi>angry</hi> to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, (ſo that he muſt needs be <hi>ſad</hi>) though he have not the grace to repent. But of the wicked man's life I ſhall ſpeake more hereafter, in the end of my diſcourſe; and therefore to returne to the godly man, of whoſe happineſſe I can never ſpeak too much. With what confidence, and ſecurity of ſpirit

For if a man be merry in good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; he muſt needs be more merry, when he enjoyes it better, and there is leſſe to diſturbe his mirth. So as it is with a godly man in the

Our ſins being the cauſe of that curſe (one would imagine ſo, did
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:119702:19"/>they know ſo much as we doe) had ſo enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them, and put ſuch an enmity in them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, that none but God himſelfe that made us both, and made them for us, was able to make them friends with us againe. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Peace with men</hi> (with <hi>unreaſonable</hi> men;<note n="*" place="margin">2 Th: 3.2.</note> which is harder to be believed, then that they ſhould have it with unreaſonable creatures) by his peaceable and amiable carriage. <hi>Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men,</hi> many ſorts of them, are odious to one another; &amp; eſpecially the <hi>proud man,</hi> who is an abomination to all men good and bad, <hi>Prov:</hi> 24.9.<note n="*" place="margin">The Scorner is an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation unto men.</note> They are not beloved of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: neither does any of them love another truly; and therefore they can have no peace. For where there is no love of another, there can be no peace in a man's ſelfe: and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſide, where there is ſuch love goes out, though there be none come in in returne, that party may have peace himſelfe, and his peace will not be a jot the leſſe, but very much the more enriched with comfort at home, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence the loſſe of ſucceſſe abroad. And therefore the godly man, who loves every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, can have peace with every body, even the wicked, that are enemies to peace, in ſpite of their teeth. Though they be not at peace with him, he is nevertheleſſe in peace with them. He will be ſure to keep his own peace, though he cannot keep the Kings, (as they uſe to call
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:119702:19"/>it.) He himſelfe will follow peace with all men:<note n="*" place="margin">Heb: 12.14.</note> whether peace follow him or not; 'tis all one to him for that. Let men be, or doe what they will. or can; he can be what he will, and will doe what he ought; and all that while he is well enough. Suppoſe they take away his cloak: he can afford to give them his coat too if that will content them: or any thing for a quiet life. Let them ſmite him on the right cheek: he had rather ſit ſtill, and turne to them the left; then trouble himſelfe much to ſave ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He had rather they ſhould break his head in an hundred places, then he ſhould break the peace, in the leaſt manner. And therefore the the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal:</hi> 119.165: after theſe words, <hi>Great peace have they that love thy law,</hi> preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly addes, <hi>And nothing ſhall offend them. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall offend them,</hi>] Nothing that <hi>befalls</hi> a godly man in this world; and nothing that the men of the world can <hi>doe</hi> to him, will <hi>offend</hi> him. Not <hi>falſe reports,</hi> not <hi>reproachfull ſpeeches,</hi> not <hi>injurious actions.</hi> For though they offend him never ſo much, yet will he never be <hi>offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> (ſo as to ſinne and offend againe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne evill for evill.) I may ſay of him, that which the Stoicks ſay of a <hi>wiſe man,</hi> that <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may wrong him, but he can never be wronged himſelfe,</hi> i:e: be any way moved, or be the worſe for the wrong. He makes no reckoning of the wrong, becauſe he does not reckon it a wrong.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:119702:20"/>And indeed (in ſome mens account of wrong) it is no wrong to him if he be willing<note n="*" place="margin">Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenti non fit injuria.</note> to take it; eſpecially if he be ſo willing, as when the party hath done one injury, to give him leave to doe another.</p>
            <p>But what doe I goe about to make it ſuch a matter, that he is not <hi>offended</hi> with any thing; when as he is able to be glad at any thing, and even to triumph over his conquering enemy, and rejoye the more for ſuffering ſo much.</p>
            <p>Or (if you will) <hi>nothing ſhall offend them,</hi> i:e: they ſhall take no offence<note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>fall,</hi> or <hi>faile,</hi> or turn out of the way which they walk in. Nor love, nor hatred; neither injuries nor courteſies; nor hopes, nor feares; neither mercies, nor judgments; neither adverſity, nor proſperity, neither life nor death, is able to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate them from their love of God (as well as God's love of them: for there is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of both: and I think they are inſeparable, as long as God can doe what he will) or make them leave that courſe of life which they have taken, or diſturbe the peace which they enjoy thereby.</p>
            <p>He that hath this <hi>Abundance of peace,</hi> how ſweetly does he goe out when the oyle of his life is ſpent! What faire weather of <hi>ſerenity of

When his ſoule lancheth forth for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther countrey, what vollies of bleſſings? (as there are of curſes when the wicked man dyes.)

               <hi>powred</hi> forth (I meane the good name which he leavs behind him) is every where to be found? Surely, it is not for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> was ſo earneſt to have men take notice of the <hi>peaceable end</hi> of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, <hi>Pſ:</hi> 37.37. <hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.</hi> When a <hi>wicked man</hi> dyes, beſides the unſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable horrour, and diſquiet of mind, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he is poſſeſſed in his departure (or, if not, a comfortleſſe, ſenſleſſe, groundleſſe preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of mercy, without any diſcovery of God, and his love, any more then beaſts have) ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like a candle blown out with the wind, he leaves a filthy ſnuffe of a foul life to ſtink behind him (having the love of no body:) or elſe, he paſſeth away like the wind, or a ſhip in the ſea; and leaves no ſigne at all; his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, &amp; life being cut off together, <hi>Pſ:</hi> 34.16.</p>
            <p>Now if a godly man have ſo much <hi>peace,</hi> who will offer to queſtion it, whether he may

The Lord thy God in the midſt of thee is mighty: he will ſave, he will rejoyce over thee with joy: he will reſt in his love, he will joy over thee with ſinging,</hi> Zeph: 3.14.15, 16, 17. Chriſtian, I cannot but wonder exceedingly what the matter is with thee, if notwithſtanding theſe things, thou art ſtill ſad. For to me it ſeemes cauſe enough why a man ſhould be <hi>mery,</hi> to have no enemies (either to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:119702:24"/>trouble him; or with whom he may trouble himſelfe. <hi>viz:</hi> with continuall feares of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking them, and thoughts and cares to have them reconciled, which is a worſe trouble then the other.) But for one that hath many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as many almoſt as there be creatures in the world, and hath them all under his feet; who can forbeare to wonder, &amp; laugh, and be enraged, to ſee ſuch a one to ſtand drooping (as if he were beaten and overcome him ſelfe) with his Creſt downe ſlat upon his head, and his wings about his heeles? Who would not wonder to ſee one that hath his yoke broken off his neck, to hang his head nevertheleſſe as bad as the Romane Souldiers did, when they had been made to paſſe under the yoke, and to walke in and out, and goe to his long home with leſſe cherefulneſſe, then the Oxe doth to his, when he hath done labouring; and rather look as if he were going to be yok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againe, or indeed as if he were going to hanging? Certainly, ſuch a one muſt needs be ignorant of what he is; or ſenceleſſe of what he knowes. For when enemies, and difficulties, and ſorrowes themſelves are vanquiſhed, it ſeemes impoſſible, if he knew his own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe (and can a man be happy and not know it?) that he ſhould not lift up his head, and waſh his beblubbered face, and anoint it with the oyle of gladneſſe. For ſhame, let him ceaſe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:119702:25"/>to ſhame his maſter whom he ſerves, to diſgrace the profeſſion which he hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, and to diſparage his own judgment and choice when he undertook it, with ſadneſſe, and ſighes and complaints, like an over labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſervant that is hardly uſed. Tell me, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou art, that art thus <hi>ſad</hi> (for I know it muſt be for feare of ſome thing) what kind of enemie is it that thou feareſt? Is it ſuch as can hurt thy ſoule, ſinne, or ſatan, or luſt? ſuch thou needeſt not. Is it ſuch as can hurt but thy body; men, or any of the creatures? ſuch thou oughteſt not to feare, <hi>Mat:</hi> 10.28. If thou art afraid then, thou art afraid both without cauſe, and ſo thou ſheweſt thy ſelfe fooliſh; &amp; againſt command, &amp; ſo thou ſheweſt thy ſelfe diſobedient. Rather therefore reſolve to be chearfull, &amp; conclude with me that thou haſt nothing to feare, but what thou haſt cauſe to love, and rejoyce in, thine own God.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Now what a comfort it is, to have God ſo ready to heare us, in our prayer, and give us an anſwer; we may gueſſe a little by the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:119702:35"/>we take pleaſure in our talking with men. whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are attentive to what we ſay, &amp; ready to anſwer our queſtion For indeed prayer is as it were a talking with God. And if it be not ſuch, it is but equivocally called prayer; as a dead man may be called a man. <hi>Becauſe</hi> (that which is moſt commonly the reaſon why <hi>prayer</hi> is no <hi>communion</hi>) it wants that which is the <hi>heart</hi> &amp; <hi>life</hi> of prayer; I meane the heart; which is the principle of <hi>life,</hi> both for naturall and ſpirituall actions. Such prayer never hath an anſwer. Or, if you will, he that prayes ſo, hath no anſwer: though the thing which he prayed for, be granted. And ſo there can be no diſcourſe or communion with God in ſuch a prayer. For the <hi>Spirit</hi> is God's only ſpokes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or Interpreter; by whom he ſpeakes. Now he does never ſpeak to any one by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> whom he does not move by his Spirit to ſpeak to him; which he does not to the wicked: but to every godly man he doth. And therefore the prayer of a godly man, is as much a <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe</hi> to him, and much more merry, then the beſt diſcourſe in the world. It is called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Job</hi> 15.4: a <hi>communing</hi> with God. For therein they <hi>commune</hi> with God, and God with them. And they may doe it as <hi>privately,</hi> as they may with their own heart (diſcourſe with friends you know, the more private it is, the more comfortable; as bread eaten in ſecret <hi>is ſweeteſt.</hi>)
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:119702:36"/>Thus God is ſaid to have <hi>communed</hi> with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> when he prayed for ſaving of <hi>Sodom,</hi> Gen: 18.33.</p>
            <p>Prayer, if it be true, is a diſcourſe that is as pleaſant and delightſome to the Godly man, as it is painfull &amp; irkſome to the wicked: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be uſed by himſelfe, or another. It is like vinegar to a wicked man's teeth, and as ſmoke to his eyes, to be in ſight or hearing of thoſe that pray: or to have the words of a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in his mouth (for that is the moſt that he hath.) He ſtands upon thornes as long as he is but in the <hi>company</hi> of ſuch as are <hi>praying:</hi> and it is worſe to him to be in the <hi>houſe of prayer</hi> then <hi>in the houſe of correction.</hi> And therefore on the other ſide (as thoſe things are uſually beſt which wicked men moſt hate) certainly a godly man cannot but be all as much <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted</hi> in prayer (or he may, if he be not leſſe godly then he ſhould be.)</p>

In the Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> you have a ſlat <hi>promiſe</hi> to this purpoſe, <hi>ch:</hi> 65.24. <hi>Before they call I will anſwer; while &amp; they are yet ſpeaking I will heare.</hi> Is there no comfort in this? I know that men cannot heare me till I have ſpoken. But God
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:119702:38"/>does not only heare me while I ſpeak, but can anſwer before I aske. I have been the longer in my diſcourſe of prayer, becauſe I would have you oftner in the uſe of it. For to tell you tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (and I can ſay ſomewhat from my own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience) for a remedy &amp; preſervation againſt melancholy; exerciſe, and company, and phyſick is not worth any thing in compariſon of it: and I know not any thing in the world, except the frequent reading of the Scriptures, that can come nere it.</p>

Nay, laſtly, how can

            <p>But you will reply, you cannot believe that a godly man can be ſo <hi>ſafe,</hi> and out of harmes way: not only becauſe of neceſſity he is expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, having nothing but naked innocency to carry about him: but that becauſe of duty he muſt expoſe himſelfe to danger and violence: giving away his cloak when his coate is gone already: giving the left cheek to him that hath ſtruck him upon the right already: giving the way to every one: and giving all that he hath, rather then give the leaſt offence.</p>
            <p>To anſwer you, what you ſay, is true in part. And I confeſſe, a godly man would have but little <hi>ſafety,</hi> if he had no more then what is of his own procuring, and if God himſelfe did not undertake his protection. But having the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of God, who will ſay, he hath not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient proviſion for <hi>Safety?</hi> And then I muſt tell you alſo, that I doe not allow him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume ſo farre upon the help of God, as not to uſe any meanes at all of his own. Neither the name of help is proper; neither doth God uſe to give it, when men doe nothing themſelves. Chriſtians are commanded to be <hi>doves</hi> (Mat: 10, 16:) as if they muſt not be quarrelſome: but they are withall allowed to be <hi>ſerpents;</hi> as
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:119702:39"/>if they might be cautelous and wiſe: not harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but when they cannot chuſe; as a ſnake, they ſay, is not unleſſe you barre up his way to his hole. But you will ſay, In the Canticles they are compared to a <hi>dove</hi> only, (as if either they would not fight: or could not well, if they would.) But what then? muſt they needs be ſo much in harmes way? what if they be <hi>hid in the clefts of the rock?</hi> Cant: 2.14. What if God <hi>hide them in the ſecret of his preſence from the pride of man? and keep them ſecret in a pavilion from the ſtrife of tongues?</hi> Pſal: 31.20. If God himſelfe hide a man, 'Ile warrant you, he knowes how to hide him where he ſhall be ſafe. And that was it, that <hi>David</hi> in his trouble choſe to <hi>fly</hi> unto him, rather then any one elſe, to <hi>hide</hi> him. <hi>Pſal:</hi> 143.9. (For <hi>I fly unto thee to hide me.</hi>) As our Saviour ſaid, <hi>If the Sonne of God make you free, you ſhall be free indeed:</hi> So may I ſay to all thoſe that are truly godly, If God hide you, or if God make you <hi>ſafe,</hi> (as indeed he does) then are you <hi>ſafe</hi> indeed; ſo <hi>ſafe,</hi> that not a haire of your head ſhall fall to the ground; and ſo ſafe that you may be <hi>ſecure.</hi> Not ſecure without care of diligence, to looke to your ſelves; but only ſecure without care of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence (and diſtruſt) not to <hi>looke unto</hi> God. Chriſtians may not be ſetled upon their <hi>lees;</hi> but they may and muſt be ſetled upon their <hi>faith. Secure</hi> they may be, not becauſe they
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:119702:39"/>preſume of not leaving God, but becauſe they are confident, God will never leave them. So ſecure, as you may imagine the Iſraelites were, when they were in the ſea. <hi>Pſ:</hi> 78.5. <hi>And he led them on ſafely, ſo that they feared not.</hi> So as <hi>Zophar</hi> allowes in the book of <hi>Job, If iniquity be in thy hand, put it farre away; and let not Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednes dwell in thy tabernacles. For then thou ſhalt lift up thy face without ſpot; yea thou ſhalt be ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt and ſhalt not feare: becauſe thou ſhalt forget thy miſery, and remember it as waters that paſſe away. And thine age ſhall be clearer then the moone: thou ſhalt ſhine forth, and thou ſhalt be as the morning. And thou ſhalt be ſecure, becauſe there is hope; yea thou ſhalt digge about thee, and thou ſhalt take thy reſt in ſafety. Alſo thou ſhalt lye down &amp; none ſhall make thee afraid,</hi> Job. 11.14. Upon condition they ſet the Lord alwaies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, as <hi>David</hi> did they may ſay as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſ:</hi> 16.8.9. <hi>I have ſet the Lord alwaies before me; becauſe he is at my right hand, I ſhall not be moved.

Thoſe that would hinder Chriſtians from this comfort uſually object that place, <hi>Phil:</hi> 2.12. <hi>Worke out your ſalvation with feare
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:119702:41"/>and trembling.</hi> To whom I anſwer, 'tis true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, though God have hedged us in on every ſide, and ſupported us with props of everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting love, which are ſo faſtned that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſlide, and ſo ſtrong that they cannot be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: yet, like the man that ſtands upon a tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er environ'd with battlements, ſo that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fall over, our legs ſhake, and our joynts tremble, and our hearts quake for feare, when we look down upon the ground from whence we came, and out of which we were made, and conſider our own frailty; and look not up to God that upholds us, and his grace and loving kindneſſe, with which we are compaſſed about, as with walls and battlements. A man in ſuch a place, though he be not afraid of failing, yet he will not, nor may not walk ſo careleſly there, as he would in another place. He may not run and play ſo in ſecurity there, as if he were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon the ground: neither may he leane too much upon the battlements, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume upon the ſtrength of the work. And ſuch preſumption <hi>Paul</hi> in that place meant to exhort the Philippians againſt, I meane pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption upon God's love. Methinks a godly man, betwixt his feares, becauſe God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawes the light of his countenance: and his confidence, becauſe he is faithfull, and will not ſuffer him to be tempted above his<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.13.</note> power (whereof the former is alwaies ſwallowed up
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:119702:41"/>by the latter) is like a child ſhaken to and fro in the armes of a loving father, and threatned to be throwne off. For though he only offer and but in jeſt; to doe it, the child being una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to helpe it ſelfe, cannot chuſe but cry, and tremble for feare. But yet all this while, he is faſt, and ſure enough. And whereas when his father lifts him out, he doubts whether he will hold him faſt, or let him goe; when he takes him in againe into his boſome, he is confident he will hold him faſt. Even ſo a godly man, when he is in the worſt of his feares, does but doubt whether God will leave him or not: but when he is in the beſt of his hopes, he is confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that God will never <hi>leave</hi> him, nor forſake him.</p>
            <p>The ſame men that urge that place in the <hi>Philippians</hi> againſt the <hi>certainty of Salvation,</hi> urge the ſame place for the <hi>merit of works.</hi> And indeed, if I were of their minde in that, I ſhould quickly be of their mind in the other too. For well may we worke in <hi>feare &amp; trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,</hi> in the worſt ſence that can be, if we are to fare as we work our ſelves: &amp; not as he that ſheweth mercy, worketh in us and for us. But, the beſt of it is, by <hi>faith we are ſaved and not by workes;</hi> and we expect to be ſaved ſo, and no otherwiſe: and we doubt not of our expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, becauſe the promiſe was of faith and not of workes, to this end, that the promiſe might <hi>be ſure,</hi> Rom: 4.16. We feare our own
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:119702:42"/>weakneſſe as much as they, and more too: and that is it which drives us to prayer to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, oftner then it doth them to the Saints: which is a fruit of our not doubting of the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of God, who <hi>is able to keep us from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>

In <hi>Deut: ch:</hi> 29.9, you find <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he exhorted the people to obedience, ſpeaking thus, <hi>Keep there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the words of this Covenant, and doe them, that ye may proſper in all that ye doe.

A great many of the Pſalmes have ſome: and ſome have a great many: and there is one that hath nothing elſe but ſuch promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. <hi>viz:</hi> Pſal: 1 28. Out of the <hi>Prophets</hi> I could promiſe hundreds. But becauſe I feare you will ſay to all that I ſhall bring thence, <hi>This is nothing to us, theſe promiſes were made under the law, to men under the law, and to be fulfilled
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:119702:45"/>under the law, and what have we to doe with the Law and the Prophets?</hi> I have look't into the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> to ſee if there be any ſuch thing there: and behold in two of the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> theſe promiſes, <hi>Bleſſed are the meek for they ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the earth,</hi> Mat: 5.5. <hi>And he ſaid unto them verily I ſay unto you, there is no man that hath left houſe or parents, or brethren, or wife or children for the Kingdome of God's ſake, who ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve manifold more in this preſent time, &amp; in the world to come life everlaſting,</hi> Luk. 18.29, 30.</p>
            <p>Whether godly men are more rich, &amp; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more godly men are rich, then there are of the wicked, I know not. This I am ſure, godly men have<note n="*" place="margin">Both ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</note> more and better waies for getting riches: I will adde, and more ready waies (though not ſeeming ſo) then the wicked have: unles they <hi>make haſt</hi> to be rich by robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and covetouſnes and oppreſſion, as they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually doe: and then ſuch haſt will breed waſt, or <hi>blind whelpes,</hi> or nothing at all. Uſually in theſe things, the furtheſt way about is the neareſt way home. Beſides worſe getting, the wicked man is uſually worſe at keeping, (which is of as great conſequencew, hether in wealth or any other thing) The wicked man's wealth is as ſoone loſt as got: melting away like ſnow (as they ſay) againſt the ſun. Their <hi>good things</hi> quickly come, and quickly goe: coming too ſoone like the untimely birth of a woman, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:119702:46"/>going too ſoone like the morning dew. Eeither the vengeance of God, or the juſtice of men, or their own vices make them ſuddainly poore. You may wonder if you ſee them without one waſting vice or other, <hi>intemperance</hi> or <hi>litigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,</hi> or <hi>prodigality,</hi> or gaming: any one of which, is able to ſet going more in one houre then he hath gotten or can get in an yeare. And if his vice be <hi>covetouſneſſe;</hi> a hundred to one, but he hath a ſonne that is a prodigall, which comes all to one: or elſe for his unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full getting, or uncharitable keeping, he hath ſome calamity or other to deprive him of it. Without queſtion, the godly man, in regard he hath none of thoſe conſuming vices; can keep and increaſe riches, better then they can, if he have them. And if he cannot get them himſelfe, why he may not have them by deſcent (as if his father hath been wicked, as they are, and ſo might get wealth by their own confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) I ſee no impoſſibility at all.</p>
            <p>But though I grant their wealth to be leſſe in quantity and bulke, or leſſe to look to, then the wicked man's: yet we know very well, that many times a little Living in quantity; by the goodneſſe of the ſoyle, or the tenure, or by freedome from ill ſervices, or inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in ſituation, or the like; is of greater value, then one that is farre greater.

               <hi>ſufficiency in all things, may abound to every good worke.</hi> For the ſecond, he hath ſo many good qualities, that no quantity ſhall alter the caſe with him.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:119702:47"/>be counted the leſſe for it. A godly man hath as much as another hath; although that which he hath, be not ſo much as the other hath. 'Tis the <hi>having</hi> (which is in the perſon:) and not the <hi>thing,</hi> (which is indifferent) that makes the odds. The perſon qualifies the<note n="*" place="margin">Mihi res non me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittere conor.</note> eſtate; and not the eſtate the perſon; unleſſe it be occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally; no more then combuſtible matter makes fire to burne.

Things are not ſaid to be much or good, ſo much from their own quantity or quality: as from the quantity or quality of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, with which they ſute or diſagree. The ſame quantity of food is too much for the little child (ſuch a one as every Chriſtian is) which is too little for an old man (ſuch as all unregenerat men are, who have not crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the old <hi>Adam.</hi>) Every one who is ſed with food <hi>convenient</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Prov: 30.8.</note> 
               <hi>for him,</hi> hath much enough. God gives to one man as muh as he knowes to be fitting for him: and to another man as much as he knowes to be fitting for him. I hope, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe is as good a man as the other: although one ſhould have never ſo much leſſe then the other. I thinke if any were worſe, it ſhould rather be he that hath moſt given him, becauſe he needeth moſt, and was not able to live with leſſe. He that hath a little meate, if
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:119702:48"/>he have but a little ſtomach: and he that hath a little cloth, if he have but a little body; doubtleſſe, are as well provided for, as he that hath much meat, and a great ſtomach to fill, and he that hath much cloth, and a great body to cloath. If a godly man's eſtate ſhould be counted little, becauſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath more, or becauſe it is ſo in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a greater: then I know not who hath much. For there is none that hath ſo much; but either he himſelfe may have more then he hath, or another have more then he.</p>
            <p>Againe, a man is not to be counted <hi>rich,</hi> for <hi>abundance</hi> of that which is <hi>hurtfull</hi> to him; but only of that which is <hi>profitable.</hi> Now the <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings</hi> of God (ſuch as all God's gifts are, if they are not abuſed) are <hi>bleſſings indeed,</hi> only to the <hi>Godly;</hi> to whom <hi>curſes</hi> themſelves are bleſſings. But, the <hi>wicked,</hi> as their <hi>curſes</hi> are <hi>curſes indeed:</hi> ſo their very bleſſings <hi>prove</hi> curſes, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>coales of fire</hi> upon their heads. <hi>Puniſhments</hi> (which are made <hi>profitable</hi> to the <hi>godly:</hi>) and outward bleſſings, (which are made harmleſſe to <hi>him</hi>) come both to the <hi>wicked</hi> man with a curſe in their mouths (ſo that they have no cauſe to rejoyce) and a ſting in their tailes (ſo that they are never the better.) <hi>There is a ſore evill which I have ſeen under the Sunne, namely riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt,</hi> Eccl: 5.13. It goes with men in regard of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall enjoyments, altogether as <hi>God</hi> goes with
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:119702:48"/>them. If a man have not God for his porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: he had as good have no portion at all. For he will have his portion, or ſomething elſe for his <hi>God;</hi> and then his condition is <hi>bad,</hi> be it never ſo <hi>good.</hi> But if God be given into the bargaine: be it little, be it much; it will fare with us, as it did with the Iſraelites, when they gathered Manna; <hi>He that gathered much had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing over, &amp; he that gathered little had no lack.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, he that hath a little eſtate, and is not in debt; or hath his debts paid; will live merrier every day of the weeke; and we uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all count him more rich, then another that is richer then he. Dayly experience ſhewes, in how deep melancholy men uſually are, that are deep in debt. How doe they wiſh above any thing in the world that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were out! &amp; how doe they bleſſe above any condition in the world, the condition of others that are not in their condition! So ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſinns committed, ſo many debts. And as the godly man is merry, becauſe his creditour is ſatisfied: and is ſo farre from being ſad for having been in debt; that he rejoyceth ſo much the more, that he was indeed the <hi>ſervant of ſin:</hi> ſo the wicked man being ſtill dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes; as long as ſinne and the law lyes at his doore; and his debts are laid to his charge; is as farre from joy, as he is from a truly quiet conſcience, and can never be truly merry. A
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:119702:49"/>godly man will owe nothing to any man, but what <hi>debet debere</hi> he <hi>ought to owe,</hi> what he ought to be ſtill paying and never have paid all, to <hi>love</hi> him. I here is none in earth therefore that can juſtly moleſt him. Neither hath hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven any thing at all againſt him. For he that paid his ranſome for him, to redeeme him from hell; hath alſo paid his debts for him to free him from heaven: having blotted out all his ſinnes againſt God, and blotted out all God's hand-writings and bills againſt him. The thought hereof muſt needs make him excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding merry, in regard that his condition before was ſo exceeding ſad: it being as great a cauſe of joy to have been miſerable, as it is of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to have been happy.</p>
            <p>Now if this be the godly man's condition: though the wicked man ſhould <hi>dip his feet in oyle,</hi> and <hi>waſh his ſteps in butter;</hi> though he have <hi>heaped up ſilver as the duſt,</hi> and <hi>gold as the mire of the ſtreets,</hi> or though he had never ſo much; yet I would ſay of the other even with his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle eſtate (if it happen ſo to be) as <hi>Gideon</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Ephraimites,</hi> Judg: 8.2. <hi>Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better then the vintage of Abiezer?</hi> But then if this be a godly man's <hi>viſible</hi> eſtate; what is his inviſible eſtate, think you? (for indeed as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 4.18. <hi>We looke not at the things which are ſeen, but the things which are not ſeen. For the things which
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:119702:49"/>are ſeen, are temporall, but the things which are not ſeen are eternall.</hi> Certainly, you cannot im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine, but his <hi>inviſible</hi> eſtate muſt needs be great: in regard that though his viſible eſtate be little; or though he have little here that any man can ſee; yet you may ſee him beare up his ſailes as ſtifly, and live as cheerefully, as the beſt. If we ſee a man live plentifully, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily; &amp; know of no eſtate he hath to maintaine it: we conclude either that he hath ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate friend to beare his charges; or that he hath ſome private eſtate; or elſe certainly is aſſured to have an eſtate ere long, &amp; therefore is reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to live accordingly. Now, the godly man, beſides the eſtate, which he hath in poſſeſſion, temporall meanes which every man ſees, &amp; ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall meanes (the meanes of grace) which few doe &amp; none can ſufficiently prize: and beſides the helpe of a moſt bountifull father to ſupply him, the comfort whereof none can ſufficiently admire; hath another &amp; greater eſtate in rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which is no leſſe then a kingdome. Behold an inviſible eſtate not to be valued or ſurveyed. An eſtate of <hi>inviſible glory,</hi> ſuch as eye hath not ſeen: an eſtate of <hi>unheard of value,</hi> ſuch as eare hath not heard: an eſtate of unconceivable greatneſſe for hight, and length, and bredth, and depth, ſuch as it hath not entred into the heart of man to concieve. Behold an eſtate not ſubject to taskes, nor taxes: not troubles,

An eſtate that lies in a better coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey then <hi>Canaan,</hi> in a better city then <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> whoſe builder and maker is God (and none but he.) Where for <hi>his earthly houſe of this tabernacle,</hi> he ſhall <hi>have a building of God, a houſe not made with hands, but eternall in the Heavens,</hi> 2 Cor: 5.1. As long as he hath ſuch an eſtate in expectation; let him have never ſo little in poſſeſſion; I will ſay to him, as it was ſaid to the Angel of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> (Rev: 2.9.) <hi>I know thy workes, and tribulation, and poverty: but thou art rich.</hi> Neither is the time ſo long till this great eſtate comes into his hands; that the goodneſſe of the thing ſhould be any whit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated by the length of the delay: (which uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally they have more then others, as I ſhall hereafter ſhew) and many times more then they would have themſelves.) For who will not ſerve twice ſeven yeares, (or, ſuppoſe a few more yeares) in hopes: if he have an aſſurance to obtaine at laſt, I ſay not a wife (and yet <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> thought not that too little a guerdon for ſo many yeares ſervice) but a never-fading <hi>Crowne,</hi> for the crowne of his hopes. There is but one of his own lives to run out. While that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, he hath a rent coming in of ſpirituall bleſſings, abundantly enough to maintaine him in heart: (in reſpect whereof I may ſay in the words of Chriſt, He hath other meat to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:119702:50"/>eate, then worldly men wot of.) And when this life ends, there is no more fine to be paid, then a little puffe of breath, to give him ſeizin, and ſet him in poſſeſſion for all eternity. And how canſt thou be ſad, O, my ſoule? For ſhame, be not thus <hi>diſquieted within me.</hi> Come, <hi>hope ſtill in God:</hi> for I will yet praiſe him, <hi>who is the health of my countenance, and my God.</hi> Till I can poſſeſſe mine inheritance, I will poſſeſſe thee with patience &amp; cheer thee up with hope of what thou haſt to come, which hope I am confident, if thou art not wanting to thy ſelfe will make thee mery, if the time be never ſo ſad.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak a little more of Hope: (for though it may ſeem to have been better put among the godly man's conditions: yet becauſe it is a grace that in it's nature hath relation to what the party is to have, and becauſe it is commonly uſed in the Scripture for it, I think better to ſpeake of it now) Joy is a proper e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effect of hope, (ſuch hope as I<note n="a" place="margin">

            <p n="5">5. (Perhaps for the former reaſon) wicked men have been heretofore made <hi>ranſoms</hi> for God's People, to ſpare them.

For elſe (to pay me againe in my own coyne) how came it about, that from <hi>Adam</hi> to the flood, of the <hi>Patriarches,</hi> who were good men, there were eleven generations; and of <hi>Cain's</hi> line, who were bad men, but eight? Anſ.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:119702:55"/>that which makes the matter better or worſe, and turnes the ſcales, riſeth from the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him that gives, and him that recieves. 'Tis not ſo much the thing, <hi>Life,</hi> that we care for; as the man's <hi>contentedneſſe</hi> in the <hi>enjoying;</hi> and (eſpecially) God's <hi>loving kindneſſe</hi> in the beſtowing, which is <hi>better then life,</hi> Pſ: 63.3.

            <p>If a wicked man's life be as long as a godly man's; yet he cannot have ſo long life. Or (if you will) a wicked man may have ſo long a life as he but he cannot have it <hi>ſo</hi> (i e: <hi>as</hi> long life.) It will never be a long life to him, though it be never ſo long; for he will be alwaies long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a longer. Whereas the godly man is not only bleſſed in, and with the having of the thing; but bleſſed in the maner of the having; <hi>viz:</hi> with content and ſatisfaction; which is a farre greater bleſſing, and without which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that nor any other thing can be a bleſſing. He hath a ſhort life <hi>ſo,</hi> as to make it long: and he hath long life <hi>ſo,</hi> as to make it long enough; or ſo as he will be ſatisfied with it: and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther having of long life, or having of life, can be properly called having it.

Methinks, the wicked man ſhould rather feare and ſuſpect what the matter is, then rejoyce, and be glad in it as a bleſſing, that he hath health or long life, when he takes
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:119702:56"/>all the courſes to the contrary. It would make a man afraid as of an ill <hi>omen,</hi> to have a hare leape into his lap, as he ſits in his houſe.

A godly man can have but little to doe, becauſe he hath but little to provide. Whatſoever any man cares to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for, is more or leſſe accordg to his appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, or his luſt, or his deſire; and his deſire ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his want (ſeeming, or reall.) A god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man's deſire, and his want of the things of the world being but little, he muſt needs have
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:119702:58"/>but little proviſion to make, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but little worke to doe, and leſſe trouble to ſuffer in the doing. He muſt not, and cannot, and will not take <hi>any</hi> care for <hi>many</hi> things: or <hi>much</hi> care for any thing. The truth is, it would ſpoile him if he ſhould: neither may he dare to doe it, any more then little and weake ſtomachs may venture upon much meate, and ſuch as is hard to be diſgeſted. A little meat will ſerve to ſuſtaine a little body, and a little care will ſerve to provide for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle meat. To eate much is hurtfull: and to care for much, needleſſe, and troubleſome. But a little too much meat not agreeing with a man's conſtitution (as earthly things cannot with a heavenly temper) is enough to diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him. And ſo is a little worldly imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a Chriſtian mind. And therefore fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a diſtemper, a godly man will take little or nothing of earthly food; and yet will live well enough: becauſe he can make it up with other food; as that man can forbeare to come to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meales with others, who can have meat when he will in private by himſelfe, and that which is better. So is the godly man: whoſe bread eaten in ſecret is ſweeter then the world can imagine. For God himſelfe <hi>who hath borns him from the belly,</hi> and <hi>fed him from the wombe,</hi> Iſa: 46.3, feedes him continually with <hi>Manna</hi> from heaven, and gives him meat to eat which
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:119702:58"/>others know not of. Tell not him of the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the men of this world; as if he lived as they doe, and followed their faſhion, which is the faſhion of <hi>this world which paſſeth away.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor 7.3.</note> Talke not to him of this world, nor of the faſhion of it. For he lives altogether after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother faſhion: not by <hi>ſight,</hi>

The Chriſtians manner of life, is and muſt be ſuch, as becomes one that does not, and muſt not ſet up his reſting place here. If he be <hi>in the body,</hi> he will reſide there as little as he can.

He hath none of the <hi>Gluttonous,</hi> or the <hi>Ambitious,</hi> or the <hi>Proud</hi> man's anxious cares for the morrow, and the things thereof. He is never diſtracted (as they are) with varieties of thoughts, of varieties of meates, drinks, cloathes, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, preferments; which ſort he ſhall chuſe, how his meat ſhall be dreſſed, and how it ſhall be ſawced; after what faſhion his cloathes ſhall be made; what place or preferment is the beſt or the greateſt, or moſt for his advantage, and how it may be compaſſed. To ſay nothing of the <hi>vexations,</hi> that are wont to follow for ſuch men, if things goe not to their minds. The poore <hi>mind</hi> is ſure to have the worſt of it. For that muſt be vexed now, for being diſpleaſed before; and one diſcontent begets another. The godly man is alwaies indifferent in ſuch matters. If he have nothing; he is contented, and patient. If he have a little, he is conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and thankfull: nay he is as glad and as mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as a man that finds a treaſure, or hath got-ſomewhat beyond his deſert and expectation. And if that little ſhould be never ſo much, yet
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:119702:59"/>will he himſelfe be the ſame ſtill; only more bountifull, and perhaps a little more merry; and this is all the change you ſhall find in him. On the contrary, for the wicked man, whoſe mind is bent after theſe things with eagerneſſe and affection; conſider what a deale of hard ſervice and toyle; what ſleepleſſe, reſtleſſe, endleſſe cares, his luſts, and paſſions, and vices, like ſo many peeviſh and never-to-be-pleaſed <hi>taſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters</hi> continually put him upon: every one commanding and domineering over him, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times <hi>all together,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>for contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deſignes,</hi> and moſt times for ſuch as cannot be followed without difficulty, and paine, and danger of the loſſe of his <hi>body.</hi> (if I ſhould ſay the <hi>ſoule,</hi> he would weigh but little of that, being a thing, which he himſelfe ſees not, nor any body elſe; and ſo, out of ſight, out of mind, and regard) If there were no ſuch <hi>contrariety</hi> in the objects, (to ſay nothing of the contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety alſo in the <hi>deſires</hi> themſelves, worſe then a <hi>civill warre</hi> in a Kingdome) the quantity and the greatneſſe of the number were enough to overloade him; and the quality, and the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of the ſorts ſufficient to diſtract him.

And it is an argument, that, as we are, we are not our ſelves: but that we have loſt our ſelves, and our natures: and that all thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:119702:63"/>of our ſoules, which ſhould be in us, are not in us; becauſe we can entertaine that which is our enemy, and ſuffer it to dwell with us, and in us, with approbation, and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; as if it were our friend. Certainly if the ſtomack were cleane, ſuch unwholſome food would never be well liked; and where the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack is not cleane, let no food be diſcommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for being diſliked. The fault is in none but the man, if the workes of piety be painfull. No imployment ought to be called painfull, becauſe it is ſo to a man that is not well.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>workes of Godlineſſe</hi> are <hi>eaſy,</hi> becauſe the <hi>vertues</hi> and <hi>graces</hi> that accompany it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce much eaſe and quiet, and content. For what a deale of eaſe hath <hi>patience,</hi> and <hi>forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> in compariſon of <hi>impatience,</hi> and <hi>rage!</hi> contempt of the world, in compariſon of <hi>world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-mindedneſſe!</hi> continence, and temperance, and contentedneſſe, in compariſon of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, importunate, and unſatisfied qualities of luſt, and gluttony, and ambition! The <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of God, how much trouble doe they eaſe us of! helping us forward in good things, and reſtraining us from evill things: either ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us, out of conſcience, not to grieve at all for loſſes and croſſes; or, out of providence, to grieve for a little while for <hi>ſinne,</hi> that we may not grieve for ever.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It may be proved by ſcripture. 1. By
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:119702:63"/>the teſtimony of Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>Mat:</hi> 11.30. <hi>My yoke is eaſy, and my burden is light.</hi> 2. By the teſtimony of <hi>the diſciple whome he loved,</hi> 1 Joh: 5., <hi>His commandements are not grievous.</hi> God's wayes are not rough with hills, and ſtones and rocks, ſuch as might make them uneaſy to goe in; but only ſo rough as not to be ſlippery, as the other wayes are. Only a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle rough-caſted (as I may ſay) with ſand, as the fighting places were wont to be; ſo whereby they are the leſſe dangerous to walke in, and much the more fit for ſouldiers and fighting men (or men continually fighting) ſuch as Chriſtians are. Whoſoever thou art therefore, that art taking a journey for the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Canaan; be not diſmaied to thinke that it will be troubleſome. <hi>When thou goeſt thy ſteps ſhall not be ſtreightned, and when thou runneſt thou ſhalt not ſtumble,</hi> Prov: 4.12.</p>
            <p>But yet after all this, I know many will be ready to ſay, that I ſpeak againſt mine own knowledge, and the opinion of every man elſe, <hi>viz:</hi> that Chriſtianity is no idle religion; but painfull and laborious: promiſing much eaſe, but enjoying but little; regarding little the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but differing all to the future. Anſw: Well, ſuppoſe I doe grant you, that it is labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious (as the waies and meanes to all excellent things are: for <hi>difficilia quae pulchra</hi> the faireſt apples are at the top of the tree, and they will
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:119702:64"/>not drop into a man's mouth, nor fall into his hands) it is not by and by grievous, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſome, &amp; voide of all pleaſure. No, Chriſtians may, and many men of neceſſity doe eate their bread in the ſweat of their face. But, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe, they may eate it with abundance of pleaſure and content. 'Tis the <hi>bread of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> calls it <hi>Prov:</hi> 31.27.) not the bread of labour and paines (unleſſe it be the bread of wickedneſſe and wrongs) that is the <hi>bread of ſorrowes.</hi> The worke of <hi>husbandry</hi> is <hi>laborious:</hi> but it is eaſy to learne and pleaſant to practiſe, &amp; affording a great deale of health and delight. The earth is dig'd with paine; but with pleaſure too; for it yeelds a ſmell wholſome to the digger in the digging (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, a treaſure may be found; and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of fruit is to come.)</p>
            <p>Againe there can be no greater torment, or cauſe of ſadneſſe, to one that hath any life in him, then to want imployment: and therefore to be laborious, cannot make godlineſſe a cauſe of ſadneſſe. Rather then men will be thus ſad, we ſe it to be their common practiſe, to practiſe vitious courſes, to keep themſelves do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: to put themſelves to any trouble, and to do any thing, rather then to ſit idle, &amp; be melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly. <hi>Labour</hi> as hard thoughts as the ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard hath of it, is the beſt pleaſure &amp; recreation to an induſtrious man: and the delight he <hi>takes</hi>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:119702:64"/>in <hi>worke,</hi> is many times more then that which he <hi>hath</hi> in <hi>profit.</hi> An induſtrious man will be ſorry when his worke is nere an end; and when he hath nothing to doe, he knowes not what to doe. He ſits, as if he were without life or ſoule, and knowes not how to diſpoſe of himſelfe: and if ſorrow or vexation ever aſſault him, then is the time. An induſtrious man can be more merry in <hi>plowing,</hi> and <hi>ſowing,</hi> with <hi>expectation;</hi> then another ſhall be at the end of harveſt, with poſſeſſion. There is more mirth, and joy, even in the <hi>labour of a righteous man</hi> that <hi>tendeth to life;</hi> then there can be in the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue</hi> of the <hi>wicked,</hi> that <hi>tendeth to ſinne,</hi> Prov: 10.16. <hi>Laborious</hi> things alwaies make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves pleaſant with <hi>Hope</hi> of <hi>profit,</hi> more or leſſe (<gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Though the godly man's labour be more, and his work be harder then the wicked man's; yet is it to him but ſo much delight and recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, if there were no other reaſon, for this alone, that though his <hi>candle goe not out in the night;</hi> though he take paines to ſow his ſeed in the morning, and in the <hi>evening withold</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Nay, ſuppoſe I ſhould grant that <hi>Godlineſſe</hi> is not only <hi>laborious,</hi> but <hi>difficult:</hi> yet it will be only to ſuch, or ſuch. It is not ſo of it ſelfe; but made ſo by him, to whom it is ſo. It is not ſo for any exceſſe of painfulneſſe in the things to be done; but for defect of painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe (or willingneſſe, or ſomething elſe) in the perſon that undertakes it. For either he is a <hi>ſluggard,</hi> one that is alwaies calling for a <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more ſleep, a little</hi>

               <note n="*" place="margin">Prov: 19.24.</note> 
               <hi>of his boſome:</hi> and therefore I need not trouble my ſelfe to ſtudy for arguments, why he may not be credited, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines of the difficulty of his work. Or, (2ly,) he is a young beginner in this way, newly entred, &amp; not yet accuſtom'd to go in the yoak of Chriſt. For one that hath been long in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way, &amp; wedded wholly to that, will not eaſily be brought to change his old <hi>mumſimus</hi> (as they ſay) for a new <hi>ſumpſimus;</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that the old is beſt, becauſe he knowes
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:119702:65"/>not the goodneſſe of the new. And ſuch a one, if he complaine; I need no other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to diſſwade you from believing him, then his own ignorance. Or, (3ly,) ſuch a one, as hath indeed been formerly accuſtomed to the yoake of Chriſt; but now, by reaſon of deſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, is grown ſtiff in the neck, and become a beginnner againe. And ſuch a one (if he did not but only act the Chriſtian, as a Hypocrite; and were not of a contrary mind to what he ſeemed to be) I ſhall need no other argument to diſſwade you from believing him, then his own knowledge. For I dare referre you to his own confeſſion, and what hee can tell you himſelfe, he once found by experience, and perhaps now deſires to find againe with a great deale of ſorrow and repentance. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou art therefore, when thou doeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good work, or duty; if thou ſindeſt it to be grievous, and painfull: doe not by and by (as the manner of moſt men is) look round <hi>about</hi> thee for the cauſe, and complaine of the hardneſſe of the work, or the maſter: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther firſt ſuſpect thy ſelfe, and examine the matter well <hi>within</hi> thee; and 'tis a thouſand to one, that thou wilt need to goe further abroad. If the rule, &amp; the work which thou doeſt, do not agree, do not therefore make the rule bad, but the worke better. Never wiſh to have the rule change. I dare warrant thee, change but thy
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:119702:66"/>ſelfe; and there will need no more to mend the matter. Be more a new creature: be more chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in thy mind; rectifie thy crooked will; pare off thy redundnat luſts; &amp; cut away the knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pieces of thy refractory ſpirit; and all will be well, and thou wilt ſay as I doe. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, if thou woudſt but conſider the matter well, and deale ingenuouſly; thou muſt needs confeſſe, that thou did'ſt not find godlyneſſe <hi>difficult,</hi> but godlyneſſe found thee <hi>untoward.</hi> The exerciſes of it, are like many of thoſe that are wont to be impoſed upon School-boyes: hard to be performed by none, but ſuch as are hard to be brought to performe them. The yoke that was eaſy ſo long agoe when Chriſt ſaid it; cannot be grown narrower with wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. (it might have grown leſſe indeed, and ſo better to be worne) Rather, thou art grown fatter with <hi>idleneſſe:</hi> or thy neck is growne big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and ſtiffer, with pride. The burden would not be ſo heavy to the firſt undertakers; but that ſhrinking their ſhoulders before they feel it, and not only not giving their mind to it, but bending their minds againſt it, they make it to be ſo themſelves. For the <hi>workes of godlineſſe,</hi> are like the <hi>words of wiſdome;</hi> all plaine to him that <hi>underſtandeth, and right to them that finde</hi>

            <p>I know, that not withſtanding all this, thou wilt ſay ſtill, the maſter thou art to ſerve, is to auſtere. <hi>He taketh up that which he laid not down,</hi> and <hi>reapeth that which he did not ſowe,</hi> as it is <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.21. <hi>He bids a lame man goe, and yet keeps his ſtaffe away from him. He bids me come out of the pit, but will not give me his hand; and yet he knowes, I can never be able to get up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. His commands are many; and he is nice in the performance of every one of them. He is not like other maſters; who are ſatisfied if their worke be well done, not examining my thoughts: but he ſearcheth my heart, and my reines, and my inmoſt thoughts before I can think them. He requires ſuch obedience; as I have no ability to performe: ſo that I muſt needs be diſobedient and ſinne; and yet, The ſoule that ſinneth ſhall dye.</hi> This is thy uſuall complaint. And indeed, I confeſſe, it is a hard caſe to be ſervant to ſuch a maſter, as thou deſcribeſt. Whom thou muſt thank moſt, that thou art in ſuch a caſe, I know not. This I know, that thou art bound to thank thy God, whom thou ſo much blameſt, that there is alſo a way made to to come out of it. He

And why he ſhould dye, when he did not ſinne; unleſſe it were to redeeme and ſave thee that diddeſt ſinne (as the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent beaſt did the ſinner, in the time of the Law) I cannot tell.</p>
            <p>Well, thus it is. what was to be done by any one, he hath done; and what was to be ſuffered by us (unleſſe it be ſome few <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>But let me be plainer with thee. Perhaps thou that makeſt theſe complaints, never trod'ſt one foot in the pathes of God's commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (and I much feare that thou art ſuch a one) For ſhame, doe not talke of the difficulty of the work which thou art to doe, before thou knoweſt what it is. The tryall of worke is only in <hi>practiſe.</hi> Firſt make tryall, and <hi>taſt, and ſee how gratious the Lord is:</hi> and then tell me after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:119702:67"/>what thou thinkeſt. Suppoſe there be ſome things (as I doe not deny but there be) that are irkſome and painfull to thy body. Be not diſmaid. Thy body will ſcarce be ſenſible of the <hi>paine;</hi> for the <hi>joy</hi> which thy ſoule takes both in doing the worke (if thou doeſt it in the beſt manner; as there be many that doe) and in the hopes of having more hereafter, when it receives the wages. If I would, I could give thee an hundred cordialls; every one of which, if thou wouldeſt take it, ſhould be ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to keep the from fainting at thy worke, under any of thy diſcouragements. But for the preſent, I will preſcribe but two meditations.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Meditate upon the <hi>immenſity</hi> of the <hi>wages,</hi> which God will give his ſervants at the laſt day: and the unſpeakable aſtoniſhing diſproporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thoſe wages bare to the worke which they doe for it. O the wonderfull lenity and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God towards them! For much ill done, they have a little temporall chaſtiſement: and for a little well doing aninfinite laſting reward. This diſproportion (for I know not what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to call it) I ſay not, 'tis a <hi>hundred fold</hi> (which our Saviour ſaid, they ſhould have in <hi>this life,</hi> Math: 19.29.) but infinitly more then an hundred times a hundred. Now what man can for ſhame ſay, he hath hard ſervice; when for a pennyworth of work, perhaps badly done; his maſter, out of love he beares him, or upon
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:119702:68"/>his ſons entreaty, or becauſe he endeavoured only to give him content, ſhall give him an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate great enough to maintaine him as long as he lives. Much more then ſhould it be a ſhame, but to think it hard ſervice; when for a little done in all, ſo as it is; and nothing at all, ſo as it ſhould be; my maſter notwithſtanding, as if I had done whatſoever was my duty to doe, or as if I had been righteous, ſhall give me ſuch a <hi>crowne of righteouſneſſe</hi> (1 Tim: 4.8,) as is a <hi>crown of life,</hi> Rev: 2.10: ſuch a <hi>crown of life,</hi> as is a <hi>crown of glory,</hi> 1 Pet: 5, 4: and ſuch a <hi>crowne of glory,</hi> as is everlaſting; an <hi>inheritance incorru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable, undefiled and that fadeth not away,</hi> 1 Pet: 1.4. Doubtleſſe, all godly men have a great deale of comfort, and joy, even <hi>in</hi> their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; to think of their end, and the reward, and profit wherewith they are crowned. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed their condition would be as comfortleſſe, if they had not ſuch thoughts: as it would be miſerable, if they had no reward. The wicked cannot take comfort in their actions, if it were for nothing but this; that though they doe not know, that they cannot profit; yet they doe not know, that they can or will. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of this, and the thought thereof, is of great concernment to cauſe a man cheerfulneſſe in working. For what ſhould one labour for the wind? yet ſo the wicked doe: which will be their complaint one day againſt themſelves, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other things, <hi>What hath pride profited us,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:119702:68"/>or what profit hath the pomp of riches brought us?</hi> Wiſd: 5.8.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Meditation is upon the <hi>greatnes and goodneſſe</hi> of thy <hi>company.</hi> Moſt men will be merry in good company, if ever they will be merry: and moſt men will ſay, <hi>The more, the merrier.</hi> A bruit creature, though his work be hard, will goe on cheerfully with company; and will keep up with the reſt, though he break his heart. To cheer-up thy ſpirit therefore, in thy <hi>march</hi> to heaven; be ever and anon think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the <hi>armies of Saints,</hi> that are gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee the ſame way. But eſpecially, I would have thee think upon him who is Captaine of the company, him I meane who is himſelfe <hi>the way</hi> it ſelfe and <hi>the life,</hi> Joh: 14.16. <hi>The Shepheard of our ſoules,</hi> 1 Pet: 2.25. <hi>The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle and high-prieſt of our profeſſion,</hi> Heb. 3.1. and <hi>the captaine of our ſalvation,</hi> ch: 2.10. <hi>Looking unto Jeſus the authour and finiſher of our faith, who for the joy that was ſet before him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the Croſſe, deſpiſed the ſhame, and is ſet down at the right hand of the throne of God,</hi> Heb: 12.2. Let it not ſeem hard and tedious to thee, but to follow ſo farre as to the Croſs; ſince it ſeemed not ſo to him, to goe firſt to be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied on it. A dog will follow his maſter thorow thick and thin; whether he call him or not, and though he knowes not whither he goes, or what it is for. And cannot I, who
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:119702:69"/>know the way that I goe, and the end of the journey, and what I ſhall have when I come thither; cannot I take a little paines, for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time, for a great reward, to follow my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour when he calls me.</p>
            <p>But perhaps after all this, thou wilt yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine object. I queſtion the <hi>goodneſſe</hi> of the ware, if it be ſo <hi>cheap</hi> as you make it. This newes is too good to be true. You told us before, <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficilia quae pulchra.</hi> Godlineſſe cannot be ſo <hi>good,</hi> as others ſay it is; and ſo <hi>eaſy too,</hi> as you make it. The beſt things (every one knowes) are <hi>hardeſt</hi> to be got, farre fetch't, and dearely bought To this I anſwer, that what I ſaid firſt, and what you ſaid laſt, is both true: and in that ſenſe which you ſpeak of, I will yeeld that <hi>god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe</hi> is <hi>difficult,</hi> viz: becauſe of difficulty in <hi>attaining to it:</hi> which difficulty, according to you, cannot be in the <hi>thing,</hi> (neither this not any other excellent thing,) becauſe it is only before we have attained to it. Now I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, we cannot ſo eaſily be willing to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe difficulty, to attaine that which we muſt enjoy and uſe with difficulty too: for we could never love it ſo well. But that godlines is thus difficult; that it is painfull, and toyleſome, and uncomfortable in it's exerciſes; ſo as a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live one merry day, as long as he hath it; but that <hi>teares muſt be his meat day and night;</hi> and his eyes muſt ſtill be <hi>conſumed with griefe,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:119702:69"/>and the apple thereof never be ſuffered to ceaſe,</hi> I doe utterly deny. Nay the more difficulty there is in getting up the hill (I meane of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of ſinne, humiliation,</hi> and <hi>repentance</hi>) the greater pleaſure doe we take to look down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, when we are up. You may obſerve it, in the hardeſt mechanick trades, that are har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt to be learned (which uſually are the beſt) the workmanſhip is eaſy to be done and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out labour, or toyle; when as in thoſe that are eaſily learned and are of an inferiour rank, you can ſcarce doe any thing to the purpoſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a great deale of ſweat, and toyle &amp; tyring. I will conclude this poynt with what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid of wiſedome, Prov: 3.17. <hi>Her wayes are waies of pleaſantneſſe: and all her pathes are peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another cauſe that a godly man hath to be merry, may be this, that,<note place="margin">tweflth ground ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorines of the objects of Love</note> 
               <hi>The objects of his love are ſatisfactory:</hi> which is the moſt neceſſary qualification of any, to make a man rejoyce in what he loves. (what a man loves the mirth of his life is moſt concerned in, and he ſpends moſt of his time about it) Where there is no ſatisfaction, but the ſtomack (as I may ſay) is ſtill hungry and empty (juſt as it is in the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the body) there muſt needs be <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content;</hi> and conſequently <hi>ſadneſſe,</hi> in the deſire of that which is wanting, and griefe for the want. But when that which a man loves, is
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:119702:70"/>ſatisfactory, and anſwers a man's deſires; and gives him <hi>enough:</hi> then, and not till then, he takes delight; and then he begins to rejoyce: as we ſay, <hi>When the belly is full, the bones are at reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the <hi>objects of a godly man's love;</hi> the firſt, and the laſt, and the chiefeſt; the <hi>fountaine</hi> from which all other objects have their ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory vertue; and the <hi>loadſtone</hi> at which they are all touched, whereby they have power to draw our hearts after them; is no other, and can be no leſſe, then God himſelfe; who is to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry godly man as he was to <hi>David;</hi> to whom he ſeemed ſo perfectly a <hi>ſatisfactory object</hi> of his deſire, that he deſired nothing in heaven or earth beſides him, <hi>Pſal:</hi> 73.25. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I deſire beſides thee.</hi> And wiſe enough he to make choyce of ſuch an object. For now, neither ought he, nor need he deſire any thing: or if he doe, he is in the faireſt way to enjoy it, having him who is <hi>all in all. He ſatisfieth the longing ſoule, and filleth the hungry ſoule with goodneſſe,</hi> Pſal: 107.9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He]</hi> that is, He <hi>alone:</hi> for elſe it is no prayſe of him. They that <hi>ſeek after another God,</hi> (ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to give them ſatisfaction and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe,) ſhall be ſure to <hi>multiply ſorrow,</hi> Pſal: 16.4. The other <hi>objects</hi> of their <hi>love,</hi> are The <hi>word,</hi> and <hi>ordinances of God,</hi> and the <hi>practiſe of good dutyes:</hi> which as they give ſatisfaction by
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:119702:70"/>
               <hi>communion</hi> with, and <hi>participation</hi> of the <hi>chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt good;</hi> ſo are they, in their own nature, good preſervatives againſt <hi>ſorrow,</hi> and ſadneſſe; being contrary to, and uſed as meanes againſt <hi>Sinne,</hi> the cauſe of all repentance and ſorrow. I would faine know, among all the things that ever a wicked man loved to have; and among all the actions that ever he loved to doe; which it was that gave him <hi>ſatisfaction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many other cauſes of joy for a godly man, might be fetched from the <hi>goodneſſe of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi> But I muſt leave a little roome for your own meditations; and I doubt not, but many of you that read me, have more knowledge and better experience.</p>
            <p>If notwithſtanding all this that hath been ſaid, and though the Lord hath <hi>ſhewne thee theſe good things;</hi> yet thy heart be heavy, and thou art ſtill dejected; whatever thou doeſt, confeſſe thy fault to be thine own. Say not, <hi>godlineſſe</hi> is this, or that. But rather ſay with <hi>David,</hi> when he was ready to think, that God had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten him, (after he had thus complained, <hi>Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promiſe faile for evermore? Hath God forgotten to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious. Hath he in anger ſhut up his tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies?</hi> Pſal: 77.8.9,) <hi>Surely this is mine own infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> and nothing elſe, verſ: 10. And come to thy ſelfe againe; as he does in the following verſes, ſaying thus, <hi>I will remember the workes
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:119702:71"/>of the Lord: ſurely, I will remember thy wonders of old. I will meditate alſo of all thy work, and talke of thy doings,</hi> verſ: 11.12. <hi>I am reſolved, I will no longer entertaine theſe melancholy phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: but I will comfort my heart with meditating upon the goodneſſe of my God, and the wonderfull things that he hath done for me,</hi> whereby my <hi>Condition</hi> is ſo good.</p>

A good conſcience,

How was holy <hi>David</hi> taken with being in the houſe of God at <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> inſomuch that if he were kept from it but a little while, his ſoule panted for it, and longed after it, and fainted for lack of it, as a thirſty <hi>hart</hi> would doe for lack of water. <hi>As the hart panteth after the water-brooks ſo panteth my ſoule after thee ô God My ſoule thirſteth for God, for the living God: when ſhall I come and appeare before God?</hi> Pſal: 42.1.2. The poore diſconſolate <hi>Captives</hi> prefered it to the beſt place in their memory, <hi>If I forget thee, O Jeruſalem, let my right hand forget her cunning,</hi> Pſ: 137.5.

Had they ſo much joy <hi>then,</hi> to goe ſo far? and cannot the godly, thinke you, have as much and more oy <hi>now,</hi> in their aſſemblies, when the houſes of prayer and preaching are ſo near their own, and the duties to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſo eaſy, and ſo cheap, and the influence from the heavens upon them ſo much more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant, and the ſunſhine of knowledge ſo much more cleare, then it was in thoſe dayes? Doubtleſſe, they have more by farre. What a comfortable delightſome ſmell doe I perceive, ſo ſoon as I come into the room where hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds are powring out vialls full of odours, ſuch as thoſe mentiond in the Revelation, which:<note n="*" place="margin">Rev: 5.8.</note> are the prayers of the Saints! But then how muſt it not needs be more comfortable, to be one of the number! One of the number, I ſay, then when ſo many ſhall joyne hands, to lift up their hearts: when they ſhall flock together with one mind, and goe boldly hand in hand to a throne not of <hi>judgment,</hi> but <hi>grace;</hi> where they are ſure to obtaine pardon for the paſt, and grace to helpe in time of need<note n="*" place="margin">Heb: 4.16.</note> for the future.</p>
            <pb n="142" facs="tcp:119702:74"/>
            <p>And if there be ſo much joy in <hi>prayer</hi> for what I want, when I am in need; what is there in <hi>praiſe,</hi> and thanks for what I have obtained when my need is ſupplyed? <hi>Prayſing</hi> can as ill conſiſt with <hi>ſadneſſe,</hi> as it can with <hi>ſinne.</hi> Of this there is conſtant uſe,<note n="*" place="margin">Eph: 5.20.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is conſtant occaſion, through the goodnes of God: &amp; therefore how can a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man ſpend much time in <hi>ſadnes?</hi> The thought of the <hi>goodneſſe of God,</hi> for which we praiſe him; &amp; our enjoyment of good things, for which we praiſe his goodneſſe; if both theſe together be not enough to make our hearts merry, I know not what can be. Eſpecially, I cannot chuſe but commend <hi>prayſing</hi> (for this uſe and purpoſe) if it be expreſſed by <hi>ſinging of pſalmes:</hi> as it uſes to be in the publique meetings of godly men. Then there is none taken up with buſines, and work, to teach, or to learne: but every one does all that he can to make and encreaſe <hi>mirth;</hi> all cheerfully together ſinging, not only in the right tune of the <hi>pſalme,</hi> and making melody with the voyce to men; but in the right tune of the <hi>heart,</hi> ſpeaking not ſo much (to be heard) to others for information, as to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others for conſolation, <hi>Eph:</hi> 5.19. <hi>Speaking to your ſelves in pſalmes and hymns and ſpirituall ſongs, ſinging and making melody in your hearts to the Lord.</hi> Believe it, there is more true mirth in ſinging one of the <hi>ſongs of Zion,</hi>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:119702:74"/>or one of the <hi>Lord's ſongs,</hi> though it be in a ſtrange land (as this world is no other to a godly man) eſpecially when men ſing with <hi>grace in their hearts to the Lord:</hi> Col: 3.16: then there can be in ſinging never ſo many of the moſt muſically compoſed <hi>ſonnets</hi> that can be imagined. For a teſtimony of the pleaſure to be found in <hi>prayſing God,</hi> I need give you no other then the <hi>Pſalmiſt's</hi> (who had practiſed this duty as much as any man, and therefore knew what belonged to it) <hi>Pſ:</hi> 135.3, <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord, for the Lord is good: ſing praiſes to his name, for it is pleaſant,</hi> Pſal: 147.1. <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord, for it is good to ſing praiſes unto our God; for it is pleaſant, and praiſe is comely.</hi> As <hi>James</hi> ſaid, <hi>If any be merry, let him ſing pſalmes,</hi>

            <p>And not only in <hi>prayers,</hi> and <hi>praiſes in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique:</hi> but in the private practiſe of any other good action whatſoever, whether of <hi>piety,</hi> or <hi>juſtice,</hi> or <hi>charity;</hi> a godly man does, or may take abundance of joy, and delight. When I am giving of almes, or good inſtructions, or a good example; how much joy and content doe I take, to think of pleaſing him whom I love beſt, of the good that will accrue to my
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:119702:75"/>brethren, of the rich reward which I ſhall have my ſelfe; and of the glory that redounds to him that enables me! Methinks I ſee how mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily an ingenuous child looks up upon his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or his father, while he is doing what he knowes will pleaſe him: and how gladly, and cheerfully, a loving wife goes about to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide what her husband loves. If there be ſo much ſtrength in that love, which many times hath no nobler, nor ſtronger principall then nature: what muſt there be in that which comes from grace! If when I am a child, and without knowledge; I can doe thus in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and love to him that begat me to miſery: what will I doe, when I am grown a ſtrong man in Chriſt (for ſuch they are, whom I moſt call upon to <hi>Rejoyce</hi>) out of obedience and love to him, who hath <hi>redeemed</hi> me to an <hi>eternall happineſſe!</hi> The very <hi>Heathen</hi> could find it in their hearts, to make their <hi>happineſſe</hi> nothing but <gap reason="foreign">

Or (if you will) that the ſoule ſhall take a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the works of the body, or the works that ſhe doth by the body: and not be able to have any by her ſelfe in her own: ſuch as I count ſpirituall exerciſes, and godly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances properly to be. (The godly man's work muſt all be done, though not done all by her.) No certainly. For as much pleaſure (no doubt) may the ſoule take, in taking the bread of life, and chewing, and ruminating up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the word of life, while men are living <hi>in the Spirit:</hi> (Gal: 5.25.) as the body can in eating the food that periſheth. And ſo in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any ſpirituall good work; as much as it can in any work of the body.</p>
            <p>Againe, ſhould not the ſoule have a recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in working; did it not take ſome pleaſure and delight therein; one would think, it were impoſſible ſhe ſhould hold out working; ſith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence her work is ſo various, and boundleſſe, and endleſſe. Now (to glance a little on the wicked man) being reaſonable in it's nature;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:119702:76"/>and ſo neceſſarily delighting in things that are reaſonable; how can it have true genuine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, &amp; be unfeignedly, and unflatteringly mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the <hi>unreaſonable, brutiſh, meerly ſenſible,</hi> (and many times ſenſleſſe) and <hi>unnaturall</hi> waies of ſinne? I grant, ſome kind of ſeeming for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced pleaſure it may have in thoſe things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it will be one time aſhamed; as being either drunk with luſt, or bewitched to madneſſe; (like a man that is tyed up to the love of an ugly woman, by the ſtrength of a potion) and that is the moſt. I grant, that even while ſhe is fetter'd and confind to things below her condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and unbecoming her breeding; ſhe may be merry as long as ſhe doth not think of it; or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſort make her ſelfe ſo, that ſhe may not. A noble ſpirit forced to be a ſervant, or a drudge, or a begger; as long as he does not think upon his condition, may be as another man, and make a ſhift, it may be, to have a ſprinkling of mirth now &amp; then, to waſh away the memory of his unhappineſſe of being brought into that condition. But yet ſtill, his heart is another way, and his mind is higher then ſo. He is like the bird in the cage; ſinging, perhaps, ſweetly, ſo that a man would doubt ſometimes, whether he had not rather be there then any where elſe: but yet ever and anon thruſting out his head at the holes; ſo that a man may be ſure, he is not where he would be, or he is not in his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:119702:77"/>and that though he ſing ſweetly and pleaſantly to you, yet it is not ſo to himſelfe. Beſides, there is a ſinging tongue, with a weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart; and all the mirth ſuch a man hath, is but ſorrow and ſadneſſe; in compariſon of that mirth which he would have, if his perſon were as free, as his ſpirit is ingenuous. Thus the ſoule of a wicked man, it is of the ſame breed that a godly man's is: and being borne as rational as his, would delight in rational actions, and in the reaſonable ſervice of God, as <hi>his</hi> does, if it were it's own ſoule; and it's own ſoule it would be, if it knew well that it is not. But alas, ſhe is not her own: For the Devill hath bought her unto ſinne for nothing, and made her a ſlave: &amp; ſhe hath ſold her ſelfe to ſlavery, to commit iniquity, for pleaſures only ſeeming ſo by the jugling tricks, and <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourgie</hi> of the tempter; and being in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of darkneſſe, does not regard to be redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. The Divill hath <hi>taken</hi> her <hi>alive,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But what doe I goe about to prove that <hi>gladneſſe</hi> may be, when I might as eaſily prove that it <hi>muſt</hi> be the companion of <hi>good actions,</hi> inſomuch that they cannot be good without it.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:119702:77"/>
               <hi>Companion,</hi> I ſay, not as bells on the neck of a horſe, to make him goe the faſter: or as ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to a pill, for feare of nauſeating good actions without it; as if it were neceſſary only thus, <hi>viz:</hi> that we, and not that God may be pleaſed. No ſurely, it is more then after this manner neceſſary. For elſe the actions might be good enough without it (as pills may be without ſweetning, if the mouth would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them) which they cannot be, no more then they can without <hi>willingneſſe,</hi> which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together neceſſary: for (I meane in this ſenſe) the will of God, cannot be performed without the will of man. To goe further, <hi>gladneſſe</hi> in the performance of duties, is more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary then the performance of duties. For a duty may not be done, and yet I may doe my duty: becauſe I may doe <hi>another</hi> duty, though I doe not this. But I cannot doe my duty at all, unleſſe I be glad, or unleſſe I be willing. (willingneſſe will cauſe gladneſſe, whereſoever it is, in ſome meaſure) I know not but it may be a command, as well as advice, <hi>Serve the Lord with gladneſſe,</hi> Pſal: 100.2. And ſo that, Pſal: 107, 22, <hi>Let them declare his workes with rejoycing.</hi> And there is excellent encouragement for as many as doe ſo: For it is ſaid, that God <hi>meeteth him that rejoyceth, and worketh righteouſneſſe,</hi> Iſa: 64.51.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, as <hi>James</hi> ſaid, <hi>If any be merry, let him ſing pſalmes:</hi> ſo I ſay, If any ſing pſalmes,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:119702:78"/>or doe any other duty, let him be merry: for God loveth not a <hi>cheerfull giver</hi> only; but a <hi>cheerfull</hi> doer of any thing elſe that is good. 'Twere better thou did'ſt ſleep, when thou broughteſt thine offering to the Lord: unleſſe <hi>thine heart encourage thee, and thy ſpirit make thee willing,</hi> Exod: 35.21.</p>
            <p>But to make the joy which is to be had by <hi>good actions,</hi> better yet (and to ſpeak a little more to what I began with) as we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to hold up our heads, and look right forward with cheerfulneſſe, upon what we are doing: ſo are we allowed to turne about our heads too ſometimes, and look backward with gladneſſe, and rejoycing upon what we have done: as a carpenter, or maſon, or any other workeman, uſes to doe upon his worke. And good turne is it, that we are ſo allowed. Elſe we ſhould ſoon tranſgreſſe. For how could we chuſe but be <hi>glad,</hi> when we have done that, which we are glad to doe when we did it, and muſt &amp; will be glad to doe, if it be to be done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine? Even <hi>good words</hi> (or <hi>words</hi> which we have well ſpoken) are to look to, like <hi>apples of gold in pictures of ſilver,</hi> Prov: 25.11. Much more then, may <hi>good actions</hi> be pleaſant to look to, and comfortable to think upon. Methinks, I ſee how joyfully <hi>Samuel</hi> ſtood upon his juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe he had lived honeſtly, and had done no body wrong. <hi>Behold, here I am: wtt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:119702:78"/>againſt me before the Lord, and before his anointed. Whoſe Ox have I taken? or whoſe Aſſe have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppreſſed? or of whoſe hand have I recie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved any bribe &amp;c:</hi> 1 Sam: 12.13.</p>
            <p>And indeed, I doe not not ſee how we can have any <hi>joy;</hi> whatever we may have elſe, if we want this cauſe. Or, it we have any; it will be very ſhort-liv'd, and ſuch as will runne away like hony, that hath no combes made before to hold it: as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaid upon thoſe words of <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom: 14.17 <hi>(Righteouſneſſe and peace and joy in the holy Ghoſt) Juſtitia, &amp; pax ipſa ergo praecedant tanquam cellulae mellis, ut adhuc labilem liquorem ſuavitatis ſolidior poſſit materia continere</hi> (comparing <hi>joy</hi> to the <hi>hony;</hi> and <hi>righteousneſſe</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> to the <hi>combes</hi>) You may remember, I told you that <hi>good actions</hi> are as pleaſant to the ſoule of a ſpirituall man (one that lives <hi>in</hi> the fleſh indeed; but not <hi>after</hi> the fleſh, but <hi>after</hi> the ſpirit, and by the faith of the Son of God) as meat and drink are to the body, when it is ſit to recieve them. And ſo indeed they are: and that not only for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, while they are (as I may ſay) in the mouth (For ſo unwholſome meat may be pleaſant to the diſtempered ſick man; and ſo the worſt actions may be pleaſant to the intemperate wicked man) but a long time after, and (as I may ſay) in the ſtomack, and the belly, and in all the body; being food of a moſt
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:119702:79"/>excellent nouriſhing quality, never turning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to choler, and bitterneſſe, ill bloud, and ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours to diſtemper and diſquiet him; but into ſpirit and life, and good bloud, ſuch as will be ready to retire to the heart in time of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and fainting to cheere him, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port him (as a wicked man's Actions like ill humours, at ſuch times uſe to run vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently thither to kill him with diſpaire.)</p>
            <p>It is all reaſon (one would think) that he who is to have ſo much happineſſe hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at pay-day, and is not to have it till then: ſhould have a little comfort now to ſtay his ſtomack as in part of payment. Neither doe I ſee, why the <hi>wicked</hi> man ſhould have ſo much <hi>ſorrow</hi> for having <hi>done ill:</hi> if he himſelfe could not, and the godly man cannot, have joy for having <hi>done well.</hi> Let the <hi>godly</hi> man's condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be every way as good, as the <hi>wicked</hi> man's is bad; which is in this reſpect bad enough, I am ſure. For doe but give a glaunce of your eye (in due time I meane to hold you longer in full view) upon the ſad troubles of mind, and the troubleſome ſadneſſe of heart, which a wicked man hath, when he looks back upon his paſt actions. I feare, he dares not doe it, for feare of the terrours of hell to torment him <hi>before his time.</hi> The <hi>paſt life</hi> of a <hi>wicked</hi> man, may be compared to the ſame thing, that he himſelfe is by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> (ch: 57.20.)
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:119702:79"/>
               <hi>viz a troubled ſea, caſting up</hi> nothing but <hi>mire and dirt</hi> in his own face, ſo that he durſt not come near it. A <hi>bankrupt-Factor</hi> cannot be more loath to look back upon his book of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts: nor a man that hath gone a great way out of his way, to looke back upon the way which he hath gone, and conſider that he is ſo much the further from the place he ſhould go to; with more penſiveneſſe, and anguiſh, and vexation. For with ſuch kind of thoughts he muſt needs be tormented, unleſſe he thinks he is ſtill in the right, and reſolve to goe on: and then he is in a more miſerable condition, and will one day have ſo much the more ſorrow. For he will be ſtill going further, and further on: and as many ſteps as he goes, ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees his miſery increaſes. His miſery (I ſay) encreaſes, if not in the next world, in this: for though it ſhall pleaſe the Lord to turne his heart, he is ſure to be troubled with the labour of going twice for once, and the vexation and loathnes to goe the ſame ſteps againe. (There muſt be going backward by humiliation, and griefe, as well as a turning into the right way) To ſay nothing of what feare a man that hath done done wickedly, continually goes in (like <hi>Cain</hi>) leſt ſome juſtice or other, or the law of men, or his wronged neighbour ſhould appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him. <hi>If any body doe but know them, they are in the terrours of the ſhadow of death,</hi> Job 24.17.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:119702:80"/>How ſadly penſive is the prodigal Steward, that hath miſpent his maſters allowance, when he lookes upon the bill of his own expences, and thinks upon the greatneſſe of his maſters expectations!</p>
            <p>Why ſhould not the joy of the <hi>godly,</hi> be all as much on the contrary? to conſider, that ſo farre as he hath gone; he hath not been a jot out of the way; but that as many ſteps as he hath made, he is by ſo much the nearer his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired home: To thinke that he hath no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to runne away like a bankrupt, and fly to the rocks and mountaines to hide him; but that he is ready at any time to come to God at a call, and give an account of his ſtewardſhip? O what an exceeding weight of comfort is it, for a man to have lived ſo well, as to be able to look every one of his former actions in the face; to paſſe all his debts and accompts over, and find never a <hi>debentur,</hi> nor the leaſt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a <hi>Croſs</hi> to his <hi>mirth,</hi> for want of a croſs from the Croſs of Chriſt to ſet to every farthing!</p>
            <p>Though at ſuch a time he could not doe as he would, but miſcarried in his deſigne by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a conſcience to be wicked: yet it is his comfort, he did as he ſhould. He had rather ſuffer, if it were never ſo much miſery of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, for doing well, now; then indure the leaſt trouble of mind for having done ill, hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. To have one laſh of the conſcience upon
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:119702:80"/>the mind, which no body ſees; is more to him, then to have a thouſand upon the naked body, and to be made a gazing ſtock of afflictions to all the world. 'Tis more miſery to him to have ſinned, then to have ſuffered. I will conclude with this queſtion. Who, doe you think, was moſt light at heart; <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who was innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wickedly ſold, to ſuffer the wickedneſſe and oppreſſion of ſtrangers: or his brethren, that ſold themſelves to doe that wickedneſſe to ſell him?

In ſuch caſes,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:119702:81"/>the cauſe of ſorrow being from within, where it is conſtantly maintained, can never keep out: &amp; ſo the ſorrow of the heart is reflected upon the heart, till like the beames of the ſun, by long &amp; much beating, it become burning hot, and hard to be quenched. In other caſes, judgment and reaſon will ſtench the bloud, and enlarge the heart where it is ſtraitned, becauſe it finds a reaſon to forbeare. But here, it wrings the more for want of reaſon; and the wiſer the man is, and the more for reaſon; the leſſe merry he will be, and the more unable to excuſe the fault: having only <hi>cauſe</hi> enough for the griefe, but no <hi>reaſon</hi> for the <hi>cauſe.</hi> Now the godly man hath little or none of this kind of trouble; if he have had but time enough to <hi>diſcipline</hi> his <hi>paſſions.</hi>

            <p>Time, I ſay: for time it requires, and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and policy, more then to conquer an army of men.

            <p>When any danger is threatned, be it from men, or the creatures, it troubles him leaſt of any. <hi>Come,</hi> ſayes he; <hi>As the mountaines are round about Jeruſalem, ſo the Lord is round about his people from hence forth and for ever,</hi> Pſ: 125.2. <hi>Either I ſhall never meet with any ſuch troubles as they talke of; or, if I doe, I am conſident that the Lord will keep me harmeleſſe; for I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber a promiſe of his, When thou paſſeſt thorow the waters I will be with thee; and thorow the rivers, they ſhall not overflow thee: when thou wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt thorow the fire thou ſhalt not be burnt; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall the flame kindle upon thee,</hi> Iſa: 43.2.</p>

He will ſay, <hi>It is the Lord; Let him doe what ſeemeth him good,</hi> 1 Sam: 3.18. <hi>What? ſhall we recieve good at the hand of God, and ſhall we not recieve evil?</hi> Job 2.10. <hi>What? we have had fathers of our fleſh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: ſhall we not much rather be in ſubjection unto the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſpirits, and live?

            <p>But you will ſay, all the <hi>faith</hi> in the world, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly make him merry, when affliction is uppon him. <hi>Anſ:</hi> Say you ſo? what? hath it nothing to comfort a man when he hath moſt need?

It is enough for <hi>infidels,</hi> to lye comfortleſſe under afflictions; and yet know, that God hath ſaid, <hi>Happy is the man whom God correcteth,</hi> Job: 5.17.

Now he is the leſſe ſad in ſuch a caſe
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:119702:91"/>becauſe he believes that word of God, <hi>As the mountaines are round about Jeruſalem: ſo the Lord is round about his people,</hi> Pſal 125, 2: and that though the power of man ſhould, yet the <hi>gates of hell</hi> never ſhall <hi>prevaile againſt him,</hi> Mat: 16.18.</p>
            <p>I have been the longer in theſe inſtances of <hi>faith,</hi> becauſe I would ſhew the <hi>young, weak,</hi> and <hi>doubtfull Chriſtian,</hi> the way of improving this grace.

            <p>Now I cannot be ſo large as to expreſſe: but, upon what is ſaid, I deſire you to conſider your ſelves, what a deale of ſadneſſe, and vexation, muſt needs attend the wicked man, who <hi>wants Faith.</hi> Every evill hath it's full power on him. When he is in want, he cannot believe that God will provide for him: and ſo <hi>maketh haſt</hi> to ſupply his want himſelfe: and making haſt, is neceſſarily ſubject to anger, obnoxious to hindrances, and can never be at leiſure to be merry.

When he is wronged, he cannot believe that God will recompence, and ſo free himſelfe of the trouble by leaving the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him: but unneceſſarily puts himſelfe to abundance of paines, and diſcontent, and vexation.

            <p>I ſhould in the next place ſpeake concerning <hi>Hope,</hi> but that I have ſpoken of it already, when I treated of the <hi>godly man's eſtate in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The next thing which I will ſpeak of; ſhall be <hi>Love:</hi> which whereſoever it is, and to whatſoever; whether it be to God, or men, or any thing elſe; expelleth any ſadneſſe, or vexation that may come from ſuch objects, as heat doth the cold. <hi>Love to God,</hi> though he ſhall whip a man never ſo much, will make him cloſe his lips, and kiſſe the rod that ſtrikes him.

And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, he cannot be angry with them, for any <hi>hurt</hi> that he receives by them: becauſe he does not take it (and ſo it is, as he takes it) as from them: no more then a man does a wound which he receives from the ſword (for ſuch a thing the wicked<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal: 17.13.</note> are in the hand of God.) No, he takes it as from God: and therefore he knowes, he muſt; nay therefore he is reſolved, he will be contented. Let it be <hi>Shimei,</hi> that curſes; and let him curſe never ſo much; yet he will ſay, <hi>'Tis the Lord,</hi> and that is all he will ſay.

For the firſt of them <hi>Patience,</hi> (I meane the <hi>Habite</hi> of ſuffering well, though a man be not actually afflicted) there is not any thing in the world, I ſhould preſcribe, ſo ſoon as it: not to put a man in a fit; but to ſet him in a kind of <hi>habit</hi> of mirth. It hath a ſoveraine vertue, to take out the ſting of the worſt reproach, that any buſie pettiſh waſp, flying in my face, will faſten upon me. It hath a vertue to take out the teeth, that it bite not at all; or to expell the power of the greateſt affliction. It will whet, and ſharpen thee a ſtomack, to ſlight the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt abuſe. It will ſtrengthen thy ſtomake, to live well upon the hardeſt fare. It will cleanſe thy ſtomake from choler, and flegme:
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:119702:94"/>from teſtineſſe to be moved, and dulneſſe to be daunted: ſo that any courſe meat ſhall pleaſe thee, any injury down with thee, and nothing ſhall make thee ſick. It will take away the loathing of the appetite, and the prejudice of the judgment, and give thee a reſolution (which many times is ſufficient) to reliſh the potion (I ſpeak of wrongs, and croſſes, and the like) like a <hi>patient</hi> indeed.</p>
            <p>A <hi>patient</hi> man will apply himſelfe betimes to the hand that ſtrikes; and getting neer the rod as ſoon as it is moved, muſt of neceſſity by ſo much abate the force of the blow, as he ſtops the motion of the rod. Either the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of an evill will be prevented: or the evill of a trouble will be ſoon allayed by ſuch a compliance. The way, many times, to prevent a blow in the face, is to ſet a man's face toward it, and catch the ball in his hand ere it come ſo farre. A thing that falls on a man from on high: if he ſtand ſtill; and either ſhrink his ſhoulders, and pluck not up his courage, but let it fall into his heels; or be taken napping; or doe not think he may be hurt, and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide not for it: may by theſe meanes beat him to the ground. Whereas if he gather up his ſpirits about him, and call up his courage, and beare up his ſhoulders, and indeavour, and ſpread his armes to imbrace it; he may bare the burden without hurt, and not lye under it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

            <p>And as in all manner of affliction, <hi>patience</hi> doth either make the burden light, before it light upon the man; or the man's heart light in bearing it: ſo much does <hi>Meekneſſe</hi> in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from men; and more too; in regard that I cannot exerciſe my <hi>patience,</hi> till there be an affliction to ſuffer; but my <hi>meekneſſe</hi> I can. Many times, the affliction which elſe would have been kindled, if I had been ſtout, and hard enough to have ſtruck fire upon; whereas by <hi>patience,</hi> it could have been only leſſened, and weakned; by my ſoftneſſe, and gentleneſſe,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:119702:95"/>and <hi>meekneſſe,</hi> is altogether prevented. A godly man, having both <hi>meekneſſe</hi> at all times, to carry himſelfe; and <hi>patience</hi> in perſecution to carry his croſſe; will either be quiet with all mens conſent, or be merry in ſpite of their teeth. A <hi>meek</hi> man hath ſeldome any bodyes ill will: becauſe being no <hi>buſy</hi> body to be in many places; he is ſeldome in any bodies way, to give him occaſion of offence. Either he is quite out of the way; private, and retired, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing his ſoule in humility: or, if he be in the way; he is ſo low, and cloſe to the ground, that none but he that hath a helliſh foot, and treads under ground, can ſtumble at him; and none but he that hath the divell in his heart, can find in his heart to moleſt him. If any malicious ſpirit ſhall be angry for want of an occaſion; and, ſithence he could not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by <hi>him</hi> by a provocation, will be moved by the divell by a temptation to injure him: he will either make the fire goe out for want of fuell, (making him leave ſtriking by not reſiſting, weakning the blow, by withdrawing his body, and lying like the dog upon his back, ſo that, unleſſe he be worſe then a dog, he will leave off biting.) Or elſe, if his enemy be reſolved to perſiſt, and there be no remedy but his <hi>body</hi> muſt needs ſuffer: yet he will be ſure his ſoule ſhall doe well enough, and with very indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion beare up.</p>
            <pb n="186" facs="tcp:119702:96"/>
            <p>He will clap his head under his wings, like the beaten Cock, (that would ſeem to be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſo much, that he may not be beaten any more) and when the other thinks he hath brought him to deſpaire, laugh in his ſleeve, (or in his heart) and be merry where no body can ſee him. Whoſoever can <hi>beare</hi> an injury offered; can eaſily <hi>forbeare</hi> to returne an other: and he that can forbeare, and hold his hand but never ſo little; will be ſo glad of his <hi>forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> and ſo proud of his <hi>patience,</hi> that for the joy which he hath for ſo doing, he would not for all the world, but he had done as he did. 'Tis as much joy to a <hi>moderate</hi> man, that he hath <hi>tempered</hi> his <hi>paſſions;</hi> as it is to a <hi>temperate</hi> man, that he hath <hi>moderated</hi> his appetite. A <hi>patient man</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Son of Syrak</hi>) <hi>will beare for a time; and afterward joy ſhall ſpring unto him,</hi> chap: 1.23.</p>
            <p>He that does not think himſelfe ſo good, as not to deſerve to <hi>ſuffer</hi> an injury; will think the <hi>offering</hi> of the injury not to be wonderd at, and the ſuffering of the thing it ſelfe not to be grieved for.</p>
            <p>I pray, doe but conſider, who is moſt likely to be merry; or who is likely to be moſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? he that is <hi>meek,</hi> and hath injuries offered, but never receives them: or he that is proud, or ſtomackfull, and provokes men to injure him, and receives the injurie, and cannot <hi>take reſt,</hi>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:119702:96"/>till he have <hi>taken rvenge?</hi> 'Tis not eaſy to think, unleſſe thou haſt tryed, what content, &amp; joy, and triumph, it is to a godly man (more then if he had obtained a conqueſt over his perſon by force) as it were to <hi>ſtarve</hi> his enemies malice, by denying it matter to feed on: to weary him out with waiting for provocations: to make him vex, and pine, and waſt his own ſtrength; and ſo to get the better of him (as <hi>Fabius</hi> did of <hi>Annibal</hi>) by ſlighting, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, and refuſing to fight with him. Such a man as this, who is merry not only <hi>by</hi> his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, but <hi>for</hi> his patience, and not only glad to ſuffer, but glad that he hath ſuffered (which is a joy that will laſt to all eternity) notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his ſufferings, let them be never ſo many, we are ſo farre from thinking him a <hi>ſad diſconſolate man,</hi> and an <hi>object of pity:</hi> that we are rather of <hi>Ariſtotl's</hi> mind, not to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend</hi> him with <hi>praiſes,</hi> but to <hi>magnify</hi> him with <hi>admirations</hi>

But eſpecially, is he thus
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:119702:100"/>ſad, if his maine vice be to be <hi>covetous,</hi> I meane in that ſenſe in which we uſually take the word, <hi>viz: covetous of money,</hi> or <hi>wealth,</hi> either to get, or to keep it, or to encreaſe it: wherein he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures ſo much paine, and feare, and diſtraction, (as, it may be. I ſhall ſhew you more fully in it's proper place.)</p>
            <p>Another cauſe of mirth which godly men uſually have (wicked men but ſeldome) is <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boriouſneſſe:</hi> and <hi>buſineſſe of mind,</hi> and <hi>love of employment: qualities,</hi> that are of excelient uſe in a man's heart, to fill up the room, and ſtop the entrance to <hi>ſorrowfull thoughts,</hi> and feares. As, on the contrary, conſtant experience tells us (and I can ſay ſomewhat my ſelfe) if a man doe not buſie his mind, but be either a <hi>buſie-bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> only, and wander about from houſe to houſe to tattle and prattle; or elſe lyes gaping, and folding his hands out of ſluggiſhneſſe; or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king pictures in his fancy, as children doe in the walls, out of penſiveneſſe and dumpiſhneſſe: I ſay, if a man have ſuch <hi>abundance of idleneſſe</hi> (as the Prophet's word is <hi>Ezek:</hi> 16 40.) let him have never ſo great <hi>abundance,</hi> and <hi>fulneſſe of bread:</hi> let him have an affluence of all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things to his mind, and let every body pleaſe him, and doe all that they can to make him merry (beſides being more expoſed to the <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations of Sathan,</hi> &amp; more open to his aſſaults, while he hath no <hi>Work</hi> a doing, to keep him
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:119702:100"/>out) his own neceſſarily <hi>active,</hi> and ſtill <hi>buſy</hi> (ſuch is the nature of his ſoule) but yet <hi>idle,</hi> and not <hi>buſied</hi> mind, and fancy, will worke him ſorrow enough, and more then ever he will be able to conquer, though nothing from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out was ever able to overcome him.</p>
            <p>Another vertue of a <hi>godly man</hi> that will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him to mirth, is <hi>Temperance:</hi> a vertue that will make the <hi>heart</hi> as light, as it doth the reſt of the <hi>body.</hi> A <hi>Temperate-man,</hi> firſt <hi>Reſolves</hi> to uſe but a little; and therefore hath not much trouble of <hi>care,</hi> to <hi>provide</hi> what he would have. Secondly, he <hi>doth uſe</hi> but a little: and therefore he hath not much trouble of <hi>feare,</hi> that it will doe him hurt. Thirdly, he <hi>hath uſed</hi> but a little: and ſo is free from the trouble of <hi>diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</hi> paine, and ſorrow, and of much loſſe to boot. It were eaſy to be large upon this: But I have much field, and I cannot tell how to ſtand long upon one place.</p>
            <p>There is one more, that is farre beyond all the reſt, a <hi>vertue,</hi> ſhall I call it? or, a <hi>compound of vertues?</hi> I meane, <hi>Harmleſnes,</hi> or <hi>Innocency,</hi> or <hi>unwillingnes to hurt</hi> any body for the preſent, or hereafter. (for of <hi>innocency,</hi> i: e: <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiltineſſe</hi> and not having done hurt hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I have ſpoken already) He that will not hurt his enemies with injuries, will never hurt himſelfe with ſorrows and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I think, there is none more troubleſome
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:119702:101"/>to himſelfe, then he that is moſt troubleſome to others. The creatures of prey, live ſolitary in deſarts, &amp; diſconſolate places: while the poore harmeleſſe ſheep, and other ſuch creatures as they are (though they be neareſt the ſlaughter) skip, and play, and think of nothing. The <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> man, intending to hurt none, and having a deſire to doe every one good (while he knows, that non-intention to hurt is ſufficient to excuſe, &amp; a deſire to doe good, good enough to commend him) can no more be ſad for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done hurt, then he hath cauſe to grieve for not having done good. 'Tis not the act of doing hurt, will make a man the worſe: no more then the power of doing well, will make him the better.</p>
            <p>With his unwillingneſſe to doe hurt (for elſe I ſhould not care much to commend him) there goes a willingneſſe to doe good, then which there is nothing that workes more <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant quiet</hi> to the ſoule of any Chriſtian: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if his endeavour be for the <hi>ſoule</hi> of his brother. The <hi>object</hi> being <hi>better;</hi> the good done is the better too, the perſon's commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more, and the joy for having done it, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. To enlarge a little here (though I have ſpoken to this purpoſe already) What a deale of comfort does a man take? what happineſſe doth he count it? and with what joy does he tell of it, and remember it, that he lifted up

            <p>And here, now I am ſpeaking of <hi>ſaving of ſoules,</hi> and <hi>converting of ſinners,</hi> (In which I comprehend <hi>ſtrengthening the weak, inſtructing the erroneous,</hi> and <hi>ignorant,</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting the afflicted,</hi> and all other ſuch actions of a godly man as theſe are, (tending to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of other mens ſoules) I have an ocean of matter before me, &amp; I have much adoe to forbeare launching into it; but I am afraid of going too farre, or tarrying too long at ſea, it is ſuch pleaſant ſayling.</p>
            <p>There are two things more in a godly man that diſpoſe him for mirth, which I will but mention. The firſt is, the <hi>Agreeing</hi> of his <hi>Will</hi> with the <hi>will of God.</hi> The ſecond is (that which will follow upon this, and the reſt of his qualifications formerly mentioned) a <hi>Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redneſſe</hi> for any condition, or time, though it be the very laſt judgment; for he lives not in <hi>darkneſſe;</hi> and therefore that day cannot come upon him as a <hi>thief in the night,</hi> 1 Theſſ: 5.4.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, that it is ſo, may not be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned: for his conſtant prayer is, <hi>Thy will be done;</hi> and his ordinary motto, <hi>The will of the Lord be done,</hi> or, <hi>It is the Lord, let him doe what ſeemeth good.</hi> And then, if it be ſo, that he may be merry in any condition, is all as true. For, if his will be according to the Lord's will: nay, if his will be at all times this, that the will
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:119702:102"/>of the Lord be done; and he knowes that there is no <hi>evill in the City,</hi> but what the will of the Lord is, ſhould be done: 'tis as impoſſible, that any evill ſhould make him ſad; as it is, that, that which is according to his will, ſhould grieve him: which cannot be.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond, that it is ſo, appeares by all my diſcourſe hitherto concerning his <hi>cenditions.</hi> For being furniſhed with good qualities, and all things neceſſary within; doubtleſſe, he is provided to entertain any gueſt that ſhall come from without, and to welcome and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with any accident. Which if it be ſo; that he cannot be ſad will follow; becauſe, being ſo prepared; he knowes how, and he hath ability wherewithall to doe it. He will uſe every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſo, as it ſhall in no way force him to ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. If it be bad; he will not be ſo much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled as to be ſad now; and if it be good; he will not be ſo much gladded, as to occaſion himſelfe to be ſad for it hereafter; as other men are wont to doe through want of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Having ſo many props, and helps, as he hath (the <hi>grounds,</hi> and <hi>cauſes of joy,</hi> which I have mentioned) and being ſo well taught as he is, by the ſpirit from within, and by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from without; and endued with ſo much ſtrength, and courage from above: like a thing that is ſquare; which way ſoever he falls, he will ſtand upright; and throw him, how you

            <p>There are alſo ſeverall other wayes for a godly man, to make himſelfe merry. I could ſhew him ſome out of <hi>Baſil,</hi> in his ſermon of <hi>Thanks-giving,</hi> wherein he explaines thoſe words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rejoyce alwayes &amp;c:</hi> For putting the queſtion, whether the Apoſtle did not exhort Chriſtians to an <hi>impoſſibility,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that at all times, either they are in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which it is impoſſible they ſhould be glad of; or have committed ſinnes, which they are bound to be forty for; he anſwers himſelfe,

Diſt: S. 2.</note> which breed ſo much ſorrow to others; to a man that is in Chriſt, prove an augmentation of joy. Secondly, that ſuch a man, in the greateſt affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, hath thoſe things to meditate upon, which will afford him abundant occaſion to rejoyce: as, among other things, his <hi>creation out of nothing;</hi> his being made after the image of God; his having reaſon, and underſtanding; his power to diſcerne between good, and evill; his reſtauration after his fall; and his hoped for reſurrection after his death.</p>
            <p>In the next place, becauſe the <hi>carnall man,</hi> (whom Ideſire to <hi>lure</hi> over to chriſtianity) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands not theſe things, &amp; is better acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with worſe; I think, it may doe well, now I have ſpoken ſo much of the chiefe <hi>cauſes of joy,</hi> which a godly man <hi>hath:</hi> to ſay ſomewhat of the chiefe <hi>cauſes of ſorrow</hi> which he <hi>hath not:</hi> eſpecially conſidering, that men of <hi>fearfull</hi> and <hi>prejudiced</hi> minds, though you tell them of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much <hi>good,</hi> which they never thought of; you had as good ſay nothing, unleſſe you tell them likewiſe, how they may avoyd never ſo little <hi>evill,</hi> which they are affraid of; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that evill be ſo cleane contrary to the good, that it cannot conſiſt with it. You ſhall never make them merry, by telling them of <hi>living in plenty,</hi> or an aſſurance of having this, or that; unleſſe you can perſwade them,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:119702:104"/>that they cannot <hi>come to poverty,</hi> by ſuch, or ſuch a miſchance; or that nothing can hinder them of it, or take it from them. There are within a man's own ſelfe, two grand enemies to his own mirth, <hi>Care,</hi> and <hi>Feare.</hi> He that hath the firſt, is ſad, becauſe he thinks he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not obtaine: and he that hath the laſt, becauſe he thinks he cannot avoyd, what he would. For the firſt, The godly man may not, (and being a godly man, <hi>will</hi> not, becauſe he <hi>may</hi> not) ſuffer it to be within him. He may not by any meanes <hi>take</hi> care upon him: and if he happen to have it <hi>thrown</hi> upon him, he hath a warrant to <hi>caſt</hi> it off againe upon <hi>God,</hi> who ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for him. See an expreſſe command for it <hi>Phil:</hi> 4, 6, <hi>Be carefull for nothing &amp;c:</hi> Be not ſollicitous; as if thou thoughteſt thy ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring were ſufficient without God's providence; or, as if God's providence were not ſufficient without thy overmuch caring. He that is ſo, muſt needs be ſad for the preſent with the trouble of <hi>care</hi> for <hi>good,</hi> and will be afterwards with the trouble of <hi>ſorrow</hi> for <hi>ill ſucces.</hi> But the godly man is never ſo, nor ſo. As for <hi>Feare,</hi> it is too cowardly an adverſary to conquer the heart of a <hi>Souldier of Chriſt. The righteous is as bold as a Lyon.</hi> His heart is too well <hi>fixed,</hi> to ſhake for <hi>Feare,</hi>

            <p>A <hi>godly man</hi> is a <hi>choyce veſſel,</hi> without cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, or breach, or leak: not to be <hi>ſunk,</hi> with the waves and troubles of <hi>conſcience;</hi> for they ſhall never be ſo ſtrong as to break him: nor yet to be <hi>overwhelmed,</hi> with the waves and troubles of <hi>afflictions;</hi> for they ſhall never riſe ſo high, as to get above him.

If he have at any time a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle touch of feare (as he may have, being <hi>a man;</hi> neither doth reaſon require that a <hi>man;</hi> or <hi>faith,</hi> that a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> ſhould be <hi>ſenſeleſſe</hi>) yet it is ſo, that he may be merry nevetheleſs, and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with trembling,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, <hi>Pſ:</hi> 2.11. But yet, I pray tell me, what ſhould he feare? It cannot be any kind of <hi>miſery:</hi> for he knowes well enough that all things <hi>work</hi> for his <hi>good;</hi> and therefore <hi>miſery</hi> too, among the reſt. Neither can it be any kind of <hi>adverſary</hi> (and who will <hi>ſlye when none purſues him?</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the <hi>terrour of God</hi> be upon him; which is only upon the wicked) for he is well eaſed of all his adverſaries; &amp; therfore feares them not. Firſt, he feares not what the <hi>divell</hi> can doe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, he cannot kill the ſoule, but with it's own ſword. I meane <hi>thoughts, words,</hi> &amp; <hi>actions:</hi> which by <hi>the grace of God</hi> he ſhall never have power of. Secondly, he feares not what <hi>Men</hi>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:119702:105"/>can doe; becauſe, they can but kill the <hi>body:</hi> and for that, he could afford to come againe, and give them thanks, becauſe of a <hi>better life,</hi> which by this meanes he enjoyed the ſooner. Thirdly, He feares not what his <hi>luſts</hi> can doe; becauſe they are <hi>Mortified</hi> themſelves, and cannot kill either <hi>ſoule,</hi> or <hi>body.</hi> Fourthly, he feares not what the <hi>World</hi> can doe; becauſe, he hath overcome, not only the <hi>temptations</hi> and <hi>tempting vanities</hi> of it, ſo as he ſcorns to be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry if he <hi>want</hi> them: but all <hi>croſſes and unpleaſing accidents,</hi> that he can meet with in it, ſo as he ſcornes to be ſorry, if he <hi>have</hi> them. Laſt of all, he feares not, either the <hi>King of terours</hi> himſelfe, <hi>Death;</hi> becauſe they two are friends now, and he hath, in a verry good ſenſe <hi>made a covenant</hi> with him; not that he may not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with him, but that he doe him no hurt: or ſecondly any of his <hi>Purſuyvants,</hi> as <hi>Sicknes,</hi> and <hi>deadly diſeaſes;</hi> becauſe, to him (that I may uſe the words of our Saviour concerning <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi> even when he knew he was to dye, <hi>John</hi> 11, 14.) They are <hi>not unto death.</hi> They are not ſent by God ſo much to <hi>kill</hi> him, &amp; take away a life that is but temporall (though that be no more, then to lay his body down <hi>ſoftly</hi> on the ground; or rather <hi>lay</hi> it <hi>up ſafely</hi> in the grave againſt a good time) as to make it <hi>better alive;</hi> that when he hath raiſed it up againe an <hi>incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible,</hi> and <hi>glorious,</hi> inſteed of a <hi>corruptible,</hi>

            <p n="1">1.

Or rather, indeed, the <hi>Soule,</hi> knowing the <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>worth,</hi> and <hi>excellency</hi> of <hi>the joy,</hi> coming from a <hi>Spirit;</hi> thinks it unfit to marre the gift in the uſe, and <hi>abaſe</hi> it in the enjoyment, by ſuffering it to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſ'd
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:119702:108"/>by lower inſtruments then ſpirituall: &amp; therefore keeps it wholy to her ſelfe, without dividing it out to many ſubjects: ſo that the <hi>joy,</hi> being undivided, muſt needs be ſtronger in it's exerciſes, by, being <hi>united:</hi> &amp; the <hi>Soule</hi> the ſtronger to exerciſe it, by being <hi>undiſtracted,</hi> &amp; more at leaſure: For ſo ſhe does all her ſelfe, and truſts not to ſervants; and who doubts, that the work is bettter done, when the miſtreſſe does it her ſelfe?</p>
            <p>Other marks there are of this joy, to be fetcht from the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>kind</hi> of it; and from the chief <hi>properties,</hi> &amp; <hi>qualities</hi> belonging to it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>properties</hi> belonging to a godly man's joy, which are not to be found in the joy of the wicked, are, 1. <hi>Truth,</hi> &amp; <hi>Sincerity.</hi> It is joy in <hi>puris naturalibus,</hi> as they ſay. 'Tis all gold, &amp; without any <hi>alloy.</hi> No mixture of wormwood in the cup, to imbitter it: no ill herb in the pot, to marre the broth. No trouble to goe with it: no bitterneſſe, or ſorrow in the bottome, to come after it. It is <hi>good</hi> without <hi>ſorrow,</hi> ſo that he does not <hi>grieve</hi> with it now: and it is <hi>good</hi> without <hi>ſinne,</hi> ſo that he need not <hi>repent</hi> of it afterwards. 'Tis without the <hi>adulteration</hi> of <hi>ſadnes,</hi> to make it <hi>uncurrant;</hi> &amp; the mixture of any thing that is <hi>evill,</hi> to make it <hi>unpleaſant.</hi> The mirth of the godly is the <hi>quinteſſence</hi> of <hi>joy;</hi> the <hi>gladneſſe of joy,</hi> as the expreſſion of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> is more then once, when he would ſet forth the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:119702:108"/>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>joy,</hi> Pſal: 43, 4, <hi>I will goe unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy.</hi> In the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall 'tis, <hi>the gladneſſe of my joy.</hi> So <hi>Pſal:</hi> 68.3. <hi>Let the righteous be glad: let them rejoyce before God: yea, let them exceedingly rejoyce.</hi> In the original 'tis, <hi>let them rejoyce with gladneſſe:</hi> as if there might be a joy, that had ſorrow with it; and as if none but the <hi>righteous</hi> could have ſuch a joy, as hath none with it.</p>
            <p>A <hi>wicked man's joy</hi> can be but little better then <hi>equivocally</hi> ſo, as a painted dog is a dog, or a dead man, a man. 'Tis not <hi>true</hi> i:e: <hi>ſincere:</hi> For it is mixt with ſorrows and never runs cleare. Neither is it <hi>true,</hi> i:e: <hi>genuine:</hi> for it is but fain'd, and hypocriticall. 'Tis no <hi>jugis aqua,</hi> water that comes from a fountaine from whence it may be continualy ſupplyed. 'Tis but like the river that <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of: dryed up in the ſcorching ſummer of adverſity, when he hath moſt need of it, and when the godly man's joy is higheſt. There is a faire <hi>outſide,</hi> indeed, of <hi>profuſe laughter,</hi> and <hi>jollity:</hi> but there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe. There ſeemes to be ſomething <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> but 'tis no more then a <hi>whited wall,</hi> with mud underneath; or as a <hi>whited ſepulcher,</hi> beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty full without, but <hi>full of dead mens bones, and rottennes within.</hi> 'Tis not <hi>gold</hi> that you ſee in a hypocrite: 'tis but <hi>gilt,</hi> upon tinne. So much <hi>gilt</hi> without; ſo much <hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>vexation,</hi> and <hi>ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> within. His <hi>inward parts</hi> are as full of vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:119702:109"/>and ſollicitous thoughts; as they are of ravening, and wickedneſſe. (<hi>Luk</hi> 11.39) His mirth is like the pleaſant itching of a ſore, that is healed to ſoone: for it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and it fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters underneath, though it look never ſo well. Within there are prickings of heart: for <hi>in the midſt of their laughter</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith) <hi>their heart is ſorrowfull:</hi> and beſides that, <hi>the end of ſuch mirth is heavineſſe,</hi> Prov: 14.13.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Property of a godly man's mirth is <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> and perfection. Fulneſſe, I ſay, <hi>abſolute,</hi> in <hi>quality,</hi> or <hi>truth;</hi> and in <hi>quantity,</hi> as much as this preſent life is capable of: For as for <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute fulneſſe of joy</hi> in<note n="*" place="margin">Melancthon <hi>upon thoſe words,</hi> Your joy ſhall be full, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.

               <hi>quantity,</hi> we muſt tarry till the next life. However, there is ſuch <hi>fulnes</hi> of this joy, even in this life; as that it cannot be exhauſted, meaſured, or expreſſed, either by the actions of the body, or the relation of the tongue.</p>
            <p>Yet is it not the worſe neither, for being ſo great: for it is all as good too; even, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſays, <hi>Full of glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet:</hi> 1.8. It is ſaid of the diſciples, <hi>Acts</hi> 13, 52, that <hi>they were filled with joy,</hi> even in a time of perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. What Chriſt hath done and ſpoken for us (and ſo whatſoever he does, or ſpeaks for us ſtill) it cannot have leſſe effect in us, then to make us truly joyfull, <hi>John</hi> 15.11. <hi>Theſe things
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:119702:109"/>have I ſpoken unto you, that my joy might remaine in you, and that your joy may be full.</hi> All <hi>redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> ones, that have ſo many mercies on every ſide, &amp; are <hi>encompaſſed</hi> with the<note n="*" place="margin">Pſ. 5.12 &amp; 32.7.</note> favour of the Lord; muſt needs be <hi>encompaſſed</hi> alſo with<note n="a" place="margin">Pſ. 32.10.</note>

               <hi>with gladneſſe.</hi> If it were not ſo; or, if it ſhould not be ſo; God would never have ſaid by his Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> chap: 65.14, that <hi>his ſervants ſhould ſing for joy of heart:</hi> (for the godly only ſing <hi>for joy of heart;</hi> the wicked ſing for <hi>want</hi> of it) nor would the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> have the Saints be ſo merry, as to <hi>ſhout for joy,</hi> Pſal: 132.9.</p>
            <p>The joy of the <hi>wicked,</hi> is never full or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, not ſo much as in <hi>ſimple</hi> being, ſo as a man may truly give it the name of <hi>joy;</hi> much leſſe in the beſt ſort of being. For there is alwaies one thing or other <hi>miſſing,</hi> or <hi>amiſſe:</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times confeſſions are drawn from their own mouth, that their mirth is not <hi>true.</hi> How uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all are theſe ſpeeches amongſt them, <hi>If this or that had been;</hi> or <hi>if this or that had not been, we had been truly mery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. A third property of a godly man's joy is, that it is <hi>Continuall.</hi> 1. <hi>Continuall without interruption:</hi> an inconvenience common to the mirth of the wicked; which comes and goes by <hi>fits,</hi> and laſts but for a moment (to ſpeak of) when it laſts longeſt, <hi>Job</hi> 20.5. A man had better be ſad, then merry ſo little while. For
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:119702:110"/>it does but ſet him a longing, and ſo leave him in paine. And yet thus it is with the mirth of the wicked: which is therefore compared by the Preacher <hi>Eccleſ:</hi> 7, 6: to the <hi>crackling of thornes under a pot.</hi> It is as ſoone out, as in: makes a great cry, and dyes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Continuall</hi> without <hi>end: everlaſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation,</hi> 2 Theſſ: 2, 16: like the <hi>liberty</hi> to which he is redeemed, and for which he joyes (ſee the prophecy of <hi>Iſaih</hi> to this purpoſe chap:<note n="*" place="margin">And the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed of the Lord ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, &amp; come to Zion with ſongs, and ever laſting joy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their heads: they ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine joy and gladneſſe, and ſorrow and ſighing ſhall flee away.</note>35.10.) like every thing elſe that comes by grace, and every <hi>way</hi> that God leads a man in, <hi>Pſ:</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Lead me in the way everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.</note>139.14. Oh happy man! how graciouſly does God deale with him! He hath a long time of <hi>health,</hi> and <hi>joy,</hi> and <hi>cheerfulneſſe of mind</hi> now <hi>before</hi> (as men uſe to have of their bodies, <hi>after</hi> ſome great diſeaſe) and joy everlaſting after the ſecond reſurection; for a very ſhort ſhaking ague, of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and pangs, when he was borne anew at the firſt reſurecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If he have a <hi>tempeſt</hi> of trouble or ſorrow, for awhile; he hath the longer, and the greater <hi>calme</hi> for it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>The godly man's joy is of as long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as he himſelfe, and his power of rejoyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:119702:110"/>is. If he and that endure for ever; ſo ſhall his joy: for the object of his joy endures for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, is not ſubject to be loſt, and cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from him, like the object of a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man's joy. <hi>Si gaudes de nummo, times furem: ſi gaudes de Domino, quid times? ſayes Auſtin</hi> upon the 144. Pſal: <hi>If thy joy be in money, thou feareſt the thiefe: but if thy joy be in God, whom feareſt thou?</hi> And therefore the ſame father up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the 84 Pſal: gives this counſell, <hi>Qui vult ſecurus gaudere, in illo gaudeat, qui non poteſt perire. He that will be ſecure in his joy, let his joy be in him, who can never periſh.</hi> We may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare this joy, as <hi>Hugo de S. Victore</hi> does God's <hi>mercy,</hi> (from whence it drops) to the <hi>oyle in the cruſe;</hi> which was ſtill ſpending but never ſpent.</p>
            <p>The <hi>wicked man</hi> is ever, and anon, in the midſt of jollity, troubled, and ſad to think, that his joy will not laſt: ſo that it is his uſuall ſaying, <hi>I ſhall weep for this another time.</hi> His mirth waſts, and leſſens, and changes colour in the uſing, according as he ſees the <hi>vanity</hi> of the thing, for which he is merry; &amp; perceives the weakneſſe, and badneſſe of the cauſe: which he will of neceſſity doe, more or leſſe, within a little time. Whereas he godly man's cauſe of his mirth being ſufficient, and ſuch as whereof he will never be aſhamed: his mirth encreaſes in the uſe; and the more the drinks, the better he may. Neither need he to feare
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:119702:111"/>that he ſhall be weary, &amp; ſo ceaſe from mirth, for want of variety: for he ſhall be contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually ſupplyed with recruits; <hi>new mercies,</hi> and <hi>new ſongs</hi> (not every <hi>morning,</hi> but) eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>moment.</hi> He ſhall never want occaſion to ſay as <hi>David</hi> did. <hi>Sing unto the Lord a new ſong,</hi> Pſal: 96, 1, <hi>Sing unto him a new ſong,</hi> Pſal: 133.3. <hi>He hath put a new ſong into my mouth:</hi> Pſal: 40.3.</p>

            <p>I Would now uſe ſome words of <hi>exhortation</hi> and <hi>reproofe;</hi> but that I find ſome rubs in in the way, which I muſt firſt remove.</p>
            <p>I heare too many object, &amp; ſay, <hi>What doe you goe about to prove this, &amp; that, &amp; to extoll the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a godly man, as if none were merry nor happy but he? when as you ſee your ſelfe plainly, and in your heart cannot but acknowledge the truth of the contrary,</hi> viz: <hi>that he is neither happy, nor merry. That he is not happy, is ſufficiently evinced by the many</hi> troubles, <hi>we know, the righteous (as you call them) have in all ages of the world, and their continuall affliction: ſo as one would think, that they alone of all men in the world, were</hi> made <hi>to ſuffer: and borne to miſery as the ſparks ſly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. To ſay nothing of that which is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, by the word that went out of Chriſt's own mouth, which muſt never returne to him againe, peremptorily ſpoken. In the world ye ſhall have tribulation,</hi> John 16.33.</p>
            <p>To ſuch I anſwer, that their argument will not hold ſtich, for want of conſequence. For godly men may be <hi>happy</hi> notwitſtanding their <hi>afflictions;</hi> and they may ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> did 2 <hi>Cor:</hi>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:119702:112"/>4.8, 9. <hi>We are troubled on every ſide; yet not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed: we are perplexed but not diſpaire. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, but not forſaken; caſt down but not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. Afflictions</hi> in this world, are not <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries</hi> to <hi>them;</hi> whatever they are to <hi>others,</hi> and what ever they are deemed to be to them: any more then <hi>fightings,</hi> and <hi>watchings,</hi> and <hi>hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips</hi> are to <hi>courageous Souldiers,</hi> and <hi>volunteers;</hi> who are as willing (as it would be their ſhame, if they were not) to <hi>undergoe danger,</hi> as to <hi>undertake ſervice;</hi> knowing they muſt take <hi>pains</hi> as well as <hi>wages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>afflictions</hi> are not <hi>miſeries</hi> to a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, ſo, as he is <hi>unhappy</hi> by having them, may be proved by theſe two reaſons. Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauſe <hi>he</hi> is prepared for them. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>they</hi> are prepared for him. Firſt, he is prepared for them, as a patient is for his phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, <hi>viz:</hi> with gentle preparatories, that they may work kindly neither too little, nor too much, ſo as he ſhould have either way cauſe to be grieved. God (who is his Phyſitian; and therefore will doe the beſt for him for his own glory; as any phyſitian will for his credit) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſends him <hi>ſuffering graces,</hi> when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to give him <hi>ſuffering times.</hi> Let <hi>poverty,</hi> and <hi>ſickneſſe,</hi> &amp; all the reſt of the reputed <hi>miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of this life, come upon him like armed men at once: they ſhall not prevaile againſt him.

               <hi>Hope,</hi> and <hi>Faith;</hi> and fenced with the armour of <hi>prayer,</hi> and <hi>patience;</hi> and being watchfull, and ſtanding ſtill upon his guard; let them come as many as they will; and let them come when they will come; he is ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve them. Nay, more then ſo, he knowes that they will come; having intelligence long agoe given him, that which was but now ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of. And therefore (to retort my obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours own arrow in their own face) being ſtill in expectation of them, and ſeeing them before they ſee him; he takes his time to fit himſelfe, and his beſt advantages to deale with his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: and ſo 'tis a thouſand to one but he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes him

            <p>To begin therefore. <hi>Afflictions</hi> may be <hi>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy</hi> to the godly man.

He that is in <hi>affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;</hi> and knowes, that all thoſe which are, or have been of his mind, are not, nor have been otherwiſe then he is; cannot in reaſon: and he that knowes that alwaies thoſe that ſhall be, ſhall not be otherwiſe: ſeeing there was a time, when he himſelfe was not (and ſo he is one of thoſe) cannot in ſenſe, expect to be otherwiſe himſelfe. Loe a <hi>neceſſity,</hi> which he himſelfe knew, that it could not be otherwiſe: inſomuch that I may ſay to him, and ſuch as he is, as <hi>Paul</hi> did to the <hi>Theſſalonians;</hi> 1 Epiſt: 3, 3, <hi>No man ſhould be moved by theſe afflictions: for your ſelves know, that we are appointed thereunto.</hi> To grieve for what a man knows muſt needs be, is folly: to grieve for what comes of his own chuſing, is worſe.

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:119702:113"/>he knew a <hi>neceſſity</hi> that ſuch muſt ſuffer affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>I need not leave this argument for the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it.

Juſt ſo we, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the beſt of us; till we are tyed with the <hi>bonds of afflictions,</hi> are apt not to care to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the <hi>bond of corruption.</hi> But after that, we will; if we are not <hi>hypocrites:</hi> who doe but<note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>cry,</hi> as long as the paine of the bonds endure: they doe not <hi>call upon</hi> him that binds them, as it is <hi>Job</hi> 36.13.<note n="a" place="margin">But the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites in heart heap up wrath, they cry not when he bindeth them.</note> Nay, ſometimes, they <hi>cry out upon</hi> him, rather then <hi>call upon</hi> him, or <hi>cry unto</hi> him.</p>
            <p>Neither doe <hi>afflictions</hi> make men only to <hi>ſee</hi> their <hi>ſinne,</hi> and the <hi>ſinfulneſſe</hi> of their <hi>pleaſures:</hi> but to <hi>leave</hi> the ſin, and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures too. I have ſeen a tame <hi>heron,</hi> that having eaten ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that he ſhould not; after he hath been driven about a little, and threatned to be be beaten, hath thrown it up againe. So we, when we have eaten that which we ſhould not, <hi>forbidden fruit,</hi> and <hi>ſowre grapes:</hi> when we have <hi>drunk in iniquity like water,</hi> and filled our ſelves with <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates,</hi> and <hi>pleaſures</hi> of <hi>ſinne:</hi> if we are beaten, and frighted alittle with the rod of God's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; 'tis a ready way to make us ſick with
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:119702:120"/>what we have eaten, and to caſt it up, and ſo loath it ever after, as never to meddle with it againe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aflictions</hi> make us leave our pleaſures <hi>for the preſent,</hi> becauſe they make them leave us: and for the future they will make us leave them, becauſe they thus left us for the preſent. I ſay, they make them leave us: for <hi>poverty,</hi> and <hi>ſickneſſe,</hi> and ſuch like evills, either <hi>diſarme</hi> our <hi>luſts,</hi> that they may not <hi>riſe:</hi> or, if they are up; keep away proviſion, and ſtarve the enemy out: by this meanes making their ſouldiers, the members of the fleſh, weak, and unable to fight with the <hi>ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adverſity</hi> hath few, or no <hi>temptations;</hi> lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no <hi>fewel</hi> to burne, and little or no fire at all to kindle. Now where there is no fewell to work upon; there the fire of <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> formerly kindled, muſt needs goe out. For, to what purpoſe ſhould I love the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which I took in the creatures; when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the creatures themſelves, by <hi>poverty;</hi> or the power to uſe them, by ſickneſſe; is taken away? So it is; that <hi>Affliction</hi> will doe you ſome good whether you will or no. You muſt ſinne (I ſpeak of ſinne <hi>ſhewing it ſelfe</hi>) the leſs for the time, in ſpite of your teeth: &amp; if after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward you returne to your <hi>vomit</hi> againe: 'tis the <hi>beaſtlineſſe</hi> of your own <hi>nature;</hi> and not the <hi>unprofitableneſſe</hi> of <hi>afflictions,</hi> that is in the fault.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:119702:121"/>Oh, for ſuch phyſick, which muſt needs make me well, when I take it, and I cannot refuſe it. By nature, I am ſo <hi>miſerably ſottiſh;</hi> that I am loath to part with mine own <hi>miſeries:</hi> being ſettled upon my lees, as the lazy boy was upon the horſe, who had rather ride, and dye with cold, then take the paines to alight, and goe, and get him a heat. Happy therefore that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, that ſnatches me out of the fire: bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that thing, whatſoever it be, that ſo leads me out of the crooked path of ſinne, that it drawes me by force.</p>
            <p>But againe <hi>afflictions</hi> bring us out of love with our <hi>pleaſures,</hi> not only for their <hi>ill nature</hi> in leaving us, when we are in a bad condition, when we have moſt need: but for their <hi>ill turne</hi> they doe us in bringing us into ſuch a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for ſo they uſually doe. <hi>Proſperity</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the <hi>cauſe</hi> of <hi>adverſity.</hi> It makes men too fat; ſo that many times their <hi>heart is as fat as</hi>

               <hi>kick</hi> againſt him that fed them, and to be led to the ſlaughter. Groſſe bodies, and ſuch as keep a full diet; are moſt ſubject to diſeaſes, and ſubject to moſt diſeaſes, and moſt ſubject to torment by their diſeaſes. When we are at eaſe, and have all things at will: either we puniſh our ſelves by ſinne, or make God to puniſh us for it; and one is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as the other, unleſs the laſt be moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:119702:121"/>When I am moſt ſubject to commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſubject to moſt commiſſions of ſinne; I am moſt ſubject to be puniſhed: and when I have moſt occaſions of ſinning, I muſt needs be moſt ſubject in this manner. So againe, when I have moſt duties to performe; I am moſt ſubject to omiſſion: and ſubject to moſt omiſſions of duties: and when I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved moſt bleſſings, I have moſt duties to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme. Either I <hi>miſtake</hi> God's goodneſſe, and preſume upon mine own: or elſe I <hi>forget</hi> it, and become <hi>unthankfull.</hi> When we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived moſt, we are deepeſt in debt, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, when men are deepeſt in debt, they have leaſt care to pay. How often were the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> warned (&amp; therefore, ſure there was need of it) to take heed, that, when they came into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and had every thing at full, they did not grow wanton, and ſin, and forget the Lord that brought them thither! See their warnings repeated, <hi>Deut:</hi> 6, 12: <hi>chap:</hi> 8.11.16, 17. <hi>chap:</hi> 9.4.</p>
            <p>Why ſhould <hi>Afflictions</hi> be counted ſuch <hi>miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> for denying us pleaſures; any more then denying children raw fruit, and ſuch things as are hurtfull for them, is to be counted their <hi>miſery,</hi> or grudging them food? Would a man, that is running over a rock, where he is ſure to break his neck; count it a <hi>miſery,</hi> to fall
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:119702:122"/>by the way, and break but his leg? or if he were going to a place where he muſt needs have loſt his life; to fall ſick by the way, or be hindred in his journey, or have his way fenced up that he <hi>cannot paſſe</hi> (as <hi>Job</hi> in his paſſion once complained,<note n="*" place="margin">He hath fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced up my way that I cannot paſſe: and he hath ſet dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in my pathes.</note> 
               <hi>ch:</hi> 19.8.) If in my <hi>proſperity,</hi> when the preſſe is full, and my fats doe overflow, and I have made my ſelfe drunk with the wine; having the the wind at my back, and the reines on my neck, I am running like a blind mettleſome horſe, with full carreer, in the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, and ſmooth, but ſlippery waies of jolity and pleaſures, into the pit of diſtruction: farre be it from me to count it a <hi>miſery,</hi> to <hi>ſlide,</hi> and have my legs broken with <hi>Affliction,</hi> that I may goe no further; or to meet with ſuch a croſſe in my way, in theſe croſſe, and crooked waies of death, as may violently throw me into the path of life. If I am like a <hi>mad man,</hi> and ready to deſtroy my ſelfe; have I cauſe to be ſad for it, or is it my <hi>miſery,</hi> to be <hi>bound?</hi> (as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is <hi>Job,</hi> chap: 36.8?) No, I ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuſe to cut of my right hand my ſelfe, and pluck out my right eye, and voluntarily throw away any thing that is moſt pleaſant to me; rather then in keeping of it, diſpleaſe, and offend my God, or my brother, or my ſelfe, or my conſcience.</p>
            <pb n="239" facs="tcp:119702:122"/>
            <p>Moreover, <hi>Affliction,</hi> as it brings us out of love with the pleaſures of the creatures and the pleaſures of ſinne: ſo it brings us in love with God, and the pleaſures of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: which are then moſt, when there are leaſt of the others; to the godly man's unſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable joy, and comfort. Who can chuſe (and if ever you were well affected, you will ſay ſo) but be raviſhed with, and deſire more of that exceeding weight of comfort, that is to be found in moſt <hi>ſecret meditations</hi> of, moſt <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent prayers</hi> to, &amp; moſt <hi>familiar converſes</hi> with all the three perſons of the moſt bleſſed Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? now, none of theſe exerciſes are better done or with leſſe disſturbance, then in a time of <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity.</hi> VVho would not love <hi>godlyneſſe</hi> ever after, that ſhould work <hi>ſuch effects</hi> in <hi>ſuch a time;</hi> if it were never ſo little while? 'Tis ſtrange to ſee, what excellent fruits there are of ſuch a ſeeming dead tree: VVhat profit, and gaine, by ſuch a dead trade, as <hi>ſuffering</hi> of <hi>affliction</hi> ſeems to be to a believer at the firſt view, and to a carnall eye at any time. Believe it, theſe fruits are recompence enough, and enough.</p>
            <p>I will ſet down therefore for a third parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, wherein <hi>Afflictions</hi> are <hi>beneficiall,</hi> viz: becauſe they make us doe like children, when ſome body hath beaten them, or when they ſee their enemies about them, <hi>viz:</hi> to cleave to God; to keep us cloſer to our Fathers ſide,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:119702:123"/>and cling the faſter about him. A child that is alwaies at home with his Father; either knowes not, or thinks not, what a happineſſe it is to have a Father. A Father is little more to him then another man. He can never love him ſo well, or prize the enjoyment of him ſo much; as one that hath been ſometime abſent from him, and knowes the want of him. The way to be much in love with any thing, is to ſee it but ſeldome: and none knowes the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of a thing, better, then he that is put to buy it. The time of <hi>Affliction</hi> is God's uſuall time, both of <hi>calling</hi> the <hi>uncalled</hi> before, and <hi>calling home againe</hi> the reſt. 'Tis his time when he will be <hi>ſought,</hi> and <hi>found</hi> of men; and 'tis his time when he makes them to ſeek him. In the ſecond of <hi>Chron:</hi> 33, 12, and 13: 'tis ſaid of <hi>Manaſſeh, When he was in affliction, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought the Lord his God, and humbled himſelfe greatly before the God of his fathers: and prayed unto him, and he was intreated of him and heard his ſupplication, and brought him againe to Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem into his kingdome. Then Manaſſeh knew that the Lord he was God.</hi> So <hi>Iſa:</hi> 19, 22: it is ſaid of Egypt, <hi>They ſhall returne even to the Lord, and he ſhall be intreated of them, and ſhall heale them.</hi> After the children of Iſrael have ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red affliction in captivity, then, ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; they <hi>ſhall ſtay upon the Lord the holy one of Iſrael in truth,</hi> Iſa: 10.20. <hi>The Lord hath called
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:119702:123"/>thee as a woman forſaken and grieved in ſpirit, and a wife of youth when thou waſt refuſed, ſaith thy God:</hi> In the ſame Prophet, <hi>chap:</hi> 54.6. And thus much did <hi>Az<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>'Tis ſaid of Chriſt,</hi> Heb: 5, 8, Though he, were a ſon, yet learned he obedience by the things which he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</note> 
               <hi>Now for a long ſeaſon, Iſrael hath been without the true God, and without a teaching Prieſt and without law: But when they in their trouble did turn unto the Lord God of Iſrael, and ſought him, he was found of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the abſence of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a father; ſo likewiſe doth the diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of his favour, encreaſe the love of the child, and make him more obedient to his command. If a child be alwaies dandled upon the knee, and ſuffered to have his will, and never denied a requeſt: 'tis a thouſand to one, but at length he ſcornes the love that is ſo cheap; and be by ſo much the more diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, by how much he hath the leſſe cauſe. 'Tis the ready way, firſt to make him <hi>ſinfull,</hi> by his forſaking his father; &amp; then to make him <hi>miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi> by his father's forſaking him. Faire wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the ſunſhine of proſperity, may cauſe thee to preſume, &amp; runne out, and play off too farre like the wanton conies, from the rock of defence, and ſo bring thee into danger: but the ſtormes of adverſity, (unleſſe thou art <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable,</hi>)
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:119702:124"/>when thou art in, will make thee keep in: and (unleſſe thou art inſenſible) when thou art out; will make thee runne in againe. Surely, afflictions (if thou haſt any thing of a Sonne in thee) will make thee hang about, and depend upon God, and look up in his face, (as the child does to his father) with teares in thy eyes, and prayers, and cryes in they mouth; and never leave moaning before him, till he take thee up, and hug thee in the armes of his Spirit, &amp; ſet thee down againe with this gracious anſwer, <hi>Be ſtill and feare not: there is nothing ſhall hurt thee; thy faith hath ſaved thee: and my love ſhall never leave thee.</hi>

            <p n="4">4. <hi>Afflictions</hi> are <hi>beneficiall,</hi> not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they make <hi>men</hi> more willing, and able to <hi>ſeek God;</hi> but (as I hinted but now) becauſe <hi>God</hi> alſo is more willing, and more eaſy to be <hi>found</hi> in a time when we are <hi>to ſeek,</hi> or <hi>at a loſſe,</hi> and can find no comfort from any thing elſe.

A ſtomack well ſcow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with purging, will reliſh <hi>wholſome meates,</hi> much the better a long time after: and a man's meat never does him more good, then when he is moſt hungry.

            <p n="8">8. <hi>Afflictions</hi> are <hi>beneficiall,</hi> becauſe they make us ſet a greater price both upon the goodneſſe of God, and the goodneſſe of his gifts and bleſſings (which we have formerly undervalued, or not valued as we ſhould) and ſo behave our ſelves with more <hi>thankfulneſſe,</hi> and <hi>humility.</hi> The <hi>price,</hi> and <hi>eſtimation</hi> of things, is alwaies raiſed by the want, and the loſſe; (according to what I ſaid before of God.) And we are never ſo well poſſeſſed with the opinion of the worth of a thing; as when we have not the poſſeſſion of the thing.</p>
            <p>From this alteration in judgment, proceed theſe fruits. Firſt, <hi>Repentance</hi> of, and ſecondly, <hi>Prayer</hi> againſt ſins which before men thought not of. For while they had what they never <hi>prayed</hi> for, and kept what they never <hi>gave thanks</hi> for, and were permitted the <hi>uſe</hi> of what
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:119702:128"/>they <hi>abuſed</hi> by intemperance, and luxury: they hardly ever thought either <hi>prayer,</hi> and <hi>thanksgiving,</hi> to be <hi>duties;</hi> or <hi>intemperance,</hi> and <hi>luxury</hi> to be <hi>ſinnes</hi> (certainly, many wicked men in their proſperity doe not, becauſe they ſee they are never the worſe, or <hi>becauſe they have no changes,</hi> Pſal: 55.19.) But now in <hi>Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> when their bleſſings are taken away; when they examine the matter, and ſearch for the cauſe: as ſoon as they look back upon. their own lives, they find the fault to be there. Aman that looks back, is like a ſtander by; and makes his own eyes ſerve for another man's. In any kind of work, if I keep on working, and never ſtop to look back; unleſſe my hand be guided by another's, I may commit many faults (or commit the ſame fault many times) which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe I would not doe; and never perceive it. So, if I have a conſtant uninterupted en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of outward felicity; unleſſe there be a ſpeciall hand of God to direct me; I ſhall ſin, and ſinne, over and over, and never change my conditions, till I change my condition. There is alſo a third fruit of this alteration of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, viz: <hi>performance of duties</hi> before omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: as prayſing of God's goodnes to all; and <hi>giving thanks</hi> for his goodneſſe to them: toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a humble acknowledgment of the mercy of the Lord that giveth, and the juſtice of the Lord that taketh away<note n="*" place="margin">Job: 1.21.</note>

            <p n="9">9. <hi>Affliction</hi> (or adverſity) is <hi>benefiicall.</hi> becauſe it makes men not only to eſteem of, but uſe proſperity better.

If a man never know, what the bread and water of affliction meanes: but alwaies ſit at a full table of worldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments; either by taking too much, he takes ſurfeit; or elſe by the foulenes of his ſtomack, and a mind overcome with luſts, and ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; his food to turnes to choler, his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe to bitterneſſe and miſery; and his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings into curſes.

With what content, and glorying, as it were, doe we heare people ſometimes talke of ſuch a diſeaſe, or of ſuch a wound which they have had! how one hath eſcaped drowning, another murdering, and another robbing: ſo that 'tis who can talk of moſt dangers he hath been in, and how well he came off; and they would not for any thing now, but they had had ſuch or ſuch a miſhhap. And this they can doe in a <hi>vain-glorious Thraſonicall</hi> boaſting; meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of a pratling humour; and ſometimes, it may be, by way of Complaint; accuſing God, to make an excuſe for themſelves, for this or that defect in the exerciſe of piety.

            <p>The truth is, either I will glory of my <hi>affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;</hi> or I will not glory at all. For if I ſhould glory of my <hi>proſperity,</hi> every wiſe man would laugh at me: even as much as he would at a ſouldier, that ſhould brag that he had never been in a skirmiſh: or a ſea-man, that ſhould expect to be commended, for that he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been in a ſtorme.

I may ſay to any of theſe, as the Philoſopher did to the Tyrant, <hi>Tundis vaſculum Anaxarchi, non Anaxar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chum. Knock, and beat, and doe your worſt. Though you break the casket in a thouſand pieces; you ſhell never be able to hurt the jewel in the

            <p>'Tis true. If a <hi>wicked</hi> man be not well in his <hi>body;</hi> he is not well in any part. If his <hi>out-workes</hi> be taken, he can hold out no longer.

            <p>A godly man may ſay to wicked men, when they object <hi>poverty</hi> to him, as <hi>M. Cato</hi> does in <hi>A. Gellius, cap:</hi> 22, <hi>vitio mihi vertunt, quia multis egeo: at ego illis, quia nequeunt egere.</hi> I may ſay, and ſay truely. Only he that can want, does not want; and he that cannot, does. You tell me that a godly man wants theſe, and theſe things, which the wicked man hath: but I tell you, he can no more be ſaid to <hi>want</hi> them, then a <hi>Butcher</hi> may be ſaid to want <hi>Homer</hi> (or ſuch another thing) becauſe his <hi>diſpoſition</hi> is ſuch, that he <hi>makes no reckoning;</hi> and his <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life</hi> is ſuch, that he makes <hi>no uſe</hi> of thoſe things which you uſually mean. 'Tis but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>neceſſary</hi> things, that he cares for: And thoſe are not many. But <hi>one</hi> thing is <hi>neceſſary:</hi> and that he hath choſen, <hi>viz:</hi> the <hi>better part.</hi> And therefore, if he have nothing at all of other things; he does not <hi>want,</hi> neither is there any thing <hi>wanting,</hi> which might make him <hi>rich e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;</hi> or by abſence whereof, his riches ſhould be ſaid to be <hi>deficient.</hi> A body is not <hi>maimed,</hi> unleſs it have loſt a <hi>principall part.</hi> Only <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative</hi> defects diſcommend a thing: and not thoſe that are <hi>negative.</hi> When we ſay, <hi>there is
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:119702:141"/>nothing wanting</hi> to ſuch or <hi>ſuch a creature,</hi> or thing that a man hath made; we meane, that it hath all that belongs <hi>neceſſarily</hi> to it.

            <p>Even ſo it is, When we ſay that a <hi>godly man wanteth nothing.</hi> For though in regard of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary goods,</hi> he be as <hi>having nothing:</hi> yet in regard of others, he is as if he <hi>poſſeſſed all things.</hi> He wants nothing that is <hi>neceſſary,</hi> either for <hi>his glorifying of God</hi> (being able to doe that beſt even <hi>in,</hi> and <hi>by</hi> his <hi>afflictions</hi>) or for <hi>God's glorifying of him,</hi> and making him happy: having God himſelfe for his portion, and ſupply of his wants; who is abundantly ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent at <hi>all times,</hi> for <hi>all perſons,</hi> in all <hi>conditions.</hi> As long as he hath <hi>him;</hi> whether he have more or leſs of other things, he <hi>hath</hi> all alike, and he <hi>is</hi> all alike. No changes make him change, unleſs it be to better; and that he often is, when he ſeemes worſe. In the <hi>want</hi> of <hi>temporall</hi> goods, his condition is ſo much better then a <hi>wicked man's:</hi> as that ſon's condition, to whom his father allowes but little in his minority, but meanes to give him a great-eſtate, when he coms to be of age, &amp; denies him nothing what is fitting in the mean time; is better then his, who hath all his mony given him before hand,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:119702:141"/>and all his portion in his hand before his time. If it pleaſeth my heavenly Father to have it ſo: I ſhall be glad, if I have not my portion, till I come home. If I had it, I ſhould miſpend it. Therefore, let it alone. 'Tis in a good hand: a hand that is <hi>cloſe</hi> enough to keep it, and <hi>open</hi> enough to beſtow it, when time ſhall ſerve. He that is of this <hi>good mind,</hi> will make any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition <hi>good enough.</hi> For the <hi>minde</hi> it is, that does all, for matter of <hi>rejoycing,</hi> or <hi>grieving,</hi> in any condition. If that be rightly diſpoſed (as it moſtly is in a <hi>godly</hi> man) let every thing goe how it will, nothing ſhall goe amiſs. For inſtance, a contented mind (which of all others is beſt diſpoſed for joy) keeps the <hi>ſoule</hi> in the ſame <hi>poſture,</hi> let things without <hi>turne</hi> how they will; by keeping <hi>Afflictions</hi> from piercing any further then the <hi>body.</hi> For if I am <hi>contented,</hi> they ſhall be there; they will ſtay there, and goe no further. But if I ſtrive and ſtorme, and tumble; I ſhall but tye my ſelfe faſter in the ſnare; and like an unruly priſoner, make my impriſonment ſtraighter, by impatience for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:119702:142"/>will not agree with, nor endure to be yoaked to the condition from which it cannot be ſeparated; I muſt ſuffer in both, and, like the Oxe that draweth back, endure ſo much the more paines, as I endeavour to endure leſſe, and be <hi>doubly afflicted.</hi>

            <pb n="282" facs="tcp:119702:144"/>
            <p>Againe, I muſt tell you. Firſt that the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> made to the godly, and mentioned in the Scriptures of their <hi>deliverance</hi> from <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> evills (and ſo of <hi>beſtowing</hi> upon them <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall bleſſings</hi>) are meant of their <hi>eternall</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance <hi>ſimply,</hi> and of their <hi>temporall</hi> delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance only <hi>conditionally,</hi> viz: as it ſhall <hi>conſiſt with God's glory, and their own good.</hi> Secondly, that moſt of them are meant to the <hi>whole Church collectively,</hi> and not to every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar member. And thirdly, that moſt of them are meant of deliverance from <hi>Spirituall evills,</hi> figured out in <hi>temporall expreſſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have done with the firſt objection, <hi>viz: that the godly man's condition is moſt miſerable,</hi> or, that they <hi>have cauſe</hi> to live the ſaddeſt life. The next objection is that, they <hi>doe live the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt life:</hi> and this, ſay they, muſt every body confeſs; for they are known by their <hi>ſad,</hi> and <hi>dejected lookes.</hi> 'Tis even a marke to know them by; and God hath long agoe ſet a <hi>marke</hi> upon them for it, <hi>Ezek:</hi> 9, 4, <hi>And the Lord ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, Go thorow the mid'ſt of the city, thorow the mid'ſt of Hieruſalem, and ſet a marke upon the foreheads of the men that ſigh, and that cry for all the abominations that are done in the mid'ſt thereof.</hi> Nay, and Chriſt <hi>bleſſed</hi> them for it, <hi>Math:</hi> 5, 4, <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourne.</hi> And we wonder (ſay they) you ſhould expect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:119702:144"/>other from men that are not of this world; but <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> and <hi>Strangers,</hi> and ſuch as <hi>ſeek another countrey;</hi> as you ſay, godly men are, and doe.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, that this concluſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>godly men,</hi> is too haſtily made. Their <hi>heart</hi> may be <hi>light</hi> enough, though their <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance</hi> be <hi>heavy.</hi> The Sun ſhines ſtill notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding a cloud: and godly men uſually put the worſt ſide outmoſt. 'Tis true, they are <hi>travellers</hi> here, and in a ſtrange countrey and <hi>while</hi> they <hi>are at home in the body,</hi> they <hi>are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the Lord</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſayes 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 5.6.) But I deny a neceſſity that therefore they muſt be <hi>ſad.</hi> Firſt, becauſe though they are <hi>travelling;</hi> they are <hi>travelling homeward.</hi> And ſuch as are travelling towards their home; you know, though their way be never ſo <hi>difficult</hi> &amp; <hi>dangerous,</hi> are the joyful'ſt men in the world. Secondly, becauſe though they are for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>abſent from the Lord;</hi> yet they are going all as faſt to him. They are <hi>preſent</hi> with him in their <hi>hearts</hi> by faith, <hi>already; ſitting with him in heavenly places,</hi> Eph: 1, 3: and they are ſure ere long to be preſent with him in their <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi> And you will little wonder; if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that they are men that <hi>walke by faith,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſayes, 2 Cor: 5.7, 8: not by <hi>ſight</hi> (and ſo, if the things which they ſee, be not to their mind, they are the leſs troubled) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:119702:145"/>not only <hi>willing,</hi> but delighted with the thought and expectation of it, to be <hi>abſent from the body, &amp; to be preſent with the Lord.</hi> They live and <hi>dye in faith</hi> like the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> Heb: 11, 13. <hi>not having received the promiſes, but only having ſeen them afarre off; &amp; are perſwaded of them: &amp; embrace them &amp; confeſs that they are ſtrangers and pilgrims on the earth:</hi> and are not troubled with the thought of it (for who will be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the thought of being a <hi>ſtranger</hi> (or a <hi>traveller</hi>) thorow a <hi>ſtrange countrey?</hi> This very <hi>deſire,</hi> and <hi>expectation</hi> of theirs will make them <hi>merry</hi> enough. The ſaying, <hi>Nil aequè gratum adeptis, ac concupiſcentibus, Nothing is ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant when it is obtained, as when it is deſired,</hi> will ſerve here: if not to undervalue the <hi>enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> yet to <hi>commend</hi> the <hi>deſire.</hi> 'Tis <hi>joy</hi> enough to be deſirous of the preſence of Chriſt, more to be in the way to obtaine it, and more yet to be ſure to obtaine it: All which agree to the godly man in this life.</p>
            <p>Yet muſt I tell you, that however, I doe not grant the firſt part of the antecedent neither altogether; as if all godly men had ſuch <hi>deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted looks.</hi> Some there be that <hi>looke,</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have</hi> themſelves worthy of their hopes. And for thoſe that doe not, I account it their <hi>fault,</hi> for which they ſhould be <hi>blamed;</hi> and not their <hi>miſery,</hi> for which they ſhould be <hi>pitied.</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence they have no <hi>cauſe,</hi> why they ſhould <hi>be
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:119702:145"/>ſorry;</hi> I ſee no cauſe why they ſhould ſeem to be ſo, unleſs it be a feare of <hi>diſpleaſing their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> if they ſhould be <hi>merry.</hi> But if they are <hi>ſad</hi> they will doe worſe: for then they are ſure to ſcandalize them, and ſinne againſt God beſides.</p>
            <p>But the truth of it is, for the moſt part, the world is out in their <hi>phyſiognomy.</hi> They doe not judge well of countenances, or if they doe <hi>judge</hi> well (to returne to my firſt anſwer) they doe not <hi>conclude</hi> well, <hi>viz:</hi> that men muſt needs <hi>be</hi> ſad, becauſe they <hi>look</hi> ſo. For they may be, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, 3 <hi>Cor:</hi> 6.10. <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>as ſad, and yet alwaies rejoycing.</hi> They are not <hi>ſorrowfull,</hi> but <hi>ſerious.</hi> They are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>as</hi> ſad: or they are as <hi>ſerious,</hi> as if they were <hi>ſad;</hi> as men that think it not becoming them, to be <hi>profuſe,</hi> and <hi>childiſhly merry;</hi> but to be <hi>conſiderate:</hi> which they cannot well be, if they be <hi>over-merry.</hi> 'Tis hard to be <hi>merry</hi> and <hi>conſider</hi> (as the preacher's word is, <hi>Ecleſ:</hi> 7, 14, <hi>In the day of proſperity be joyfull, but in the day of adverſity conſider.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are no more ſad, then is neceſſary for a couragious man to be, when he is in the mid'ſt of his eneimies; or upon the ſea, in a ſtorme; or in any dangerous place.

For when he is moſt afflicted, he is moſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that ſince he hath not his portion in this world, he is one of thoſe that are to have it in another. He is <hi>glad</hi> of it, as a priſoner, that hath deſerved death, is glad when he comes to
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:119702:146"/>be <hi>whipt;</hi> becauſe now he preſumes that he ſhall not be <hi>hanged.</hi> He can be <hi>proud</hi> of it, like a valiant <hi>Champion,</hi> that he is choſen out by God himſelfe to fight a combate with ſuch ſtrong adverſaries, as the divell, and the world, and the fleſh: whom it can be no ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and glory to conquer. Nay he can <hi>glory</hi> with the <hi>beaten Apoſtles,</hi> * that he is <hi>counted worthy</hi> to ſuffer. He counts it an honour to drink of Chriſt's own Cup; Though it be with <hi>ſickneſſe,</hi> and much againſt the ſtomack, he will joyfully <hi>pledge</hi> him. He will cheerfully goe any where, as long as he hath ſuch a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before him. Whereas elſe he would be ſad, and feare, that God had laid him aſide as a ſtone unfit for his building (<hi>viz:</hi> if he did not beate him with the hammer of affliction) that he had given him over, as not fit to be wrought upon, leaving him to himſelfe and ſo to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: Now, he is merry, and gathers heart, and reſolves to beare up ſaile, becauſe he thinks, like the ſick man, that there is hope of life, ſo long as the <hi>Lord</hi> giveth him <hi>phyſick,</hi> and <hi>keeps</hi> him <hi>under</hi> with a <hi>diet</hi> of <hi>Affliction.</hi> Like a man that hath a diſeaſe already upon him, or a cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy body about him, ſo that he needs the help of phyſick: Becauſe he thinks he hath need of it, he cannot but be a <hi>little</hi> ſad, and penſive &amp; fearfull, till he take it: but when he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it, unleſſe he be a child, or a mad-man, or a
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:119702:147"/>foole; he is preſently glad, though it put him to never ſo much paine, becauſe he is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it will doe him good; and he expects eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry houre when it will. <hi>Affliction</hi> is the Godly man's <hi>ordinary phyſick,</hi> which he takes of courſe: and, like a man that hath been uſed to <hi>Phyſick,</hi> at ſuch and ſuch certaine times, and forbeares it but once; 'tis a hundred to one but he is preſently ſick, if he want it. He is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſubject to many ſpirituall diſeaſes, and therefore is glad when he uſes the meanes, and is in a courſe of <hi>Phyſick</hi> to be cured and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Now what ſpirit hath ſo weak an edge as to be dulled with a little <hi>affliction</hi> which (though it were more) is not only attended with, but the cauſe it ſelfe of ſo much good?</p>

Such a houſe may be blown upon, but it cannot be ſhaken. Such a Ship may be toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but it cannot be loſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A godly man is even as ſuch an houſe, or ſuch a ſhip. And he knowes it very well: And therefore, though he <hi>expects,</hi> yet he <hi>feares</hi> not the worſt. Let his enemies be never ſo mortall he knowes they are <hi>mortall,</hi> and he ſhall ſoon be eaſed of them. Let them never leave thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting for his blood, till they draw it out; his ſoule is able to live upon the blood which ſuch as they are, drew from him his Saviour: and ſo long he cares not. Let the <hi>men</hi> of <hi>this world plow</hi> upon his back, and make the furrowes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo long, ſo he may bear good corne: Let the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>this world</hi> ſhake him, and <hi>winnow</hi> him

               <hi>like wheat.</hi> For now he will ſay with <hi>Ignatius</hi> (when he heard the roaring of the Lyons, that were appointed to devoure him) <hi>Chriſti frumentum ſum, I am glad of it.

            </p>
            <p>Let men talke what they will, of the <hi>magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity,</hi> &amp; <hi>fortitude of</hi> the <hi>old Romanes,</hi> and the <hi>heathen Phyloſophers;</hi> as if it were not to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarell'd. I am confident, that many a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian hath a great deale more, and better, then any of them had. <hi>Pet: Martyr</hi> in his common places (<hi>claſſ:</hi> 3. <hi>c:</hi> 12.) puts the queſtion, <hi>An ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti homines inferiores fuerint Ethnicis in feren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis rebus rebus adverſis? whether the Saints were inferiour to the heathen in patience.</hi> And having brought ſome of the beſt examples among'ſt them, as of <hi>Horatius Pulvillus</hi> (who having news brought him of his Son's death, as he was conſecrating the Temple, went on his work, and was not a jot moved at it.) And of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axogoras</hi> (who having the ſame newes brought him, only made anſwer, <hi>ſciebam me mortalem genuiſſe,</hi> That he <hi>had not begotten an immortall Sonne.</hi>) And ſome others; yet determines. Firſt, that the Chriſtians were no whit inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to them: And that if Chriſtians did at any time grieve at the newes, or upon the thought
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:119702:151"/>of death, or the like; it was becauſe they were better men then thoſe heathen were, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might or would glorify God more, and doe more good if they lived: or for ſuch like cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Then he applyes to this purpoſe the ſtory of <hi>Ariſtippus.</hi> Who being asked by a Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner why he was fearfull being a <hi>Philoſopher;</hi> whereas he who never knew any Philoſophy at all, was not? replyed, <hi>Non debuiſti ſollicitus eſſe tu pro animâ nebulonis, ego videbam Ariſtip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pum Philoſophum periclitari. For your part, you ſhould not be ſollicitous for the life of ſuch a poore knave as you are: but I ſaw, that Ariſtippus the Philoſopher was in danger to be loſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe <hi>Romanes,</hi> and <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> feared not death, or grieved not for it, <hi>quod poſt hanc vita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nulla reliqua eſſent,</hi> becauſe they thought, after a man was dead, there was an end with him: whereas the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> grieved not, or was not afraid of death, becauſe there was <hi>not</hi> an end with him; but there was a life to live, in which men ſhould be rewarded or, puniſhed, for what they had done in this; which is farre more to be commended, and a ſigne of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter courage.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The fortitude, and courage of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then was but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a kind of <hi>ſtupour,</hi> a <hi>want,</hi> not a <hi>moderation</hi> of paſſions &amp; griefe, which <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, is <hi>omnibus vitiis pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, worſe then all vices. They</hi> had no <hi>patience,</hi>
               <pb n="298" facs="tcp:119702:152"/>but in <hi>want</hi> of <hi>ſence;</hi> which could be none at all: whereas <hi>theſe</hi> had none but when the ſence was quickeſt: which muſt needs be beſt of all.</p>
            <p>And then fourthly, he anſwers that <hi>their courage,</hi> if it were never ſo much, was not at all pleaſing to God (which is Saint <hi>Auſtin's</hi> opinion alſo contra <hi>Julianum,</hi> lib: 4. cap: 4.) becauſe it proceeded not from <hi>Faith;</hi> as the courage of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> does, (for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is no more pleaſing to God then theirs was.)</p>
            <p>I know, yet you will ſay, that 'tis impoſſible that <hi>fleſh and blood,</hi> meeting with ſo many ſad accidents as Chriſtians uſually doe, ſhould forbeare to look ſad, and be ſo too. But for my part I know no ſuch neceſſity. Indeed I confeſſe a godly man (and ſo he may at any other time, as well as then) may have ſadneſs upon the top of his countenance. But alas, ſo many <hi>ſad</hi> (as we uſe the word) and <hi>ſerious,</hi> and <hi>ſober dry</hi> thoughts, as he hath, are enough to produce that without any ſorrow. This is ſuch a <hi>ſadneſs,</hi> as I canot <hi>pitty,</hi> or diſpraiſe; but rather <hi>commend</hi> it, as the Preacher does, <hi>It is better to goe to the houſe of mourning, then to goe the houſe of feaſting; for that is the end of all men, &amp; the living wil lay it to his heart. Sorrow is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then laughter: for by the ſadneſs of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the heart is made better. The heart of the wiſe is in the houſe of mourning: but the heart of
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:119702:152"/>fooles is in the houſe of mirth,</hi> Eccleſ: 7.2, 3, 4. But as for <hi>ſorrow,</hi> and <hi>griefe,</hi> and <hi>vexation</hi> of heart; a godly man hath not ſuch <hi>vipers</hi> nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed within him. He hath <hi>ſorrow</hi> for <hi>ſinne</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: but then he hath <hi>joy</hi> never the leſs; and his <hi>joy</hi> is never the leſs for his <hi>ſorrow.</hi> I will undertake it, there is more true mirth in a godly man's heart one houre, even in the mid'<hi>ſt</hi> of his <hi>ſighings;</hi> then any wicked man hath with all his <hi>tighings,</hi> &amp; <hi>ſneerings</hi> all the day. For ſuch a ſorrow is ſo fare from deſtroying joy; that it is the <hi>cauſe</hi> of <hi>joy,</hi> and the cauſe of the <hi>beſt joy,</hi> and the <hi>beſt cauſe</hi> of the <hi>beſt joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reader, 'tis ſtrange to conſider, how a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man excell's a wicked man in matter of joy. A godly man can joy that he hath joyed, and joy that he hath ſorrowed, and joy for any thing: And ſo with all my heart let him ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid, <hi>doleat homo Chriſtianus, &amp; de dolore gaudeat, Let a Chriſtian man grieve, and rejoyce in his griefe.</hi> On the contrary, the wicked man's <hi>joy</hi> is <hi>ſorrowfull:</hi> for he <hi>ſorrowes</hi> for his <hi>joy,</hi> for <hi>hurting others.</hi> And his <hi>ſorrow</hi> is exceeding <hi>ſorrowfull:</hi> for he <hi>ſorrowes</hi> for his <hi>ſorrow,</hi> for <hi>hurting himſelfe.</hi> His ſorrow is but <hi>worldly</hi> at the beſt, and accordingly it <hi>worketh death,</hi> one way, or other. Seldome have you known the godly man's ſorrow, which is a <hi>god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow,</hi> to cauſe him to doe any thing to hurt his <hi>body,</hi> either by <hi>hanging himſelfe,</hi> or <hi>breaking
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:119702:153"/>his heart</hi> or the like. That he does his ſoule <hi>good</hi> by it for <hi>this</hi> world, he knowes it by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derience; and for the world to come, by the word of God.</p>
            <p>Of this good nature is his ſorrow for ſinne. And he hath little or none other ſorrow, to ſpeak of, but what is, of this nature. <hi>David</hi> Pſal: 38, though he complaines indeed of his ſicknes, and the diſeaſes of his body: yet, it ſemes, he could deale pretty well with them. But when he comes to feele the burden of his <hi>ſinnes,</hi> and the diſeaſes of his <hi>ſoule;</hi> then he is ready to ſink, verſe 4, <hi>They are as a weighty burden, too heavy for me.</hi> If he ſpeaks of <hi>ſorrow,</hi> (as he does verſe 17, <hi>My ſorrow is continually before me</hi>) preſently he makes mention of <hi>ſinne</hi> verſe 18, <hi>for I will declare mine iniquity, I will be ſorry for my ſinne,</hi> ſo Pſal: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>5, verſe 17, 18, <hi>The trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of mine heart are enlarged; O bring thou me out of my diſtreſſes. Look upon mine affliction, and my paine, and forgive all my ſins.</hi> He no ſooner ſpeaks of his <hi>afflictions,</hi> but he prayes for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of his <hi>ſinnes.</hi> He is ſure to complaine of them, what ever he complaine of elſe; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which lay heavieſt, and longeſt upon his ſtomack.</p>
            <p>To ſpeake the truth, the ſoule never truly grieves, but for what is either <hi>in</hi> her, that ſhould not be in her; or done <hi>by</hi> her, that ſhould not be done by her, the being or doing whereof,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:119702:153"/>could, or ſhould have been prevented. (ſuch a thing is <hi>ſinne</hi>) <hi>Plus dolet qui, quod intus eſt, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let.</hi> Griefe within the ſoule ſhall never be, or it ſhall never be much, for things that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, with which it hath nothing to doe. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo niſi ſuâ culpâ diù dolet, The griefe is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over, when I my ſelfe have no hand in the cauſe.</hi> If I am never ſo much <hi>at a fault,</hi> or to ſeek for a worldly good: If I am not <hi>in fault</hi> too; it ſhall never trouble me a whit. All the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that any man hath, that walketh in the way of godlineſs, he hath it not from the way, but from turning out of the way. Hence it is partly, if godly men are ſeen at any time to be ſorrowing for outward evills, they are but (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) <hi>as ſorrowing, and yet rejoycing.</hi> For their ſorrow is no more then a ſpark of fire is in the ſea, ſuddenly quenched with waters of comfort, and rivers of joy of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> If there be a <hi>mixture</hi> of both joy, and ſorrow; <hi>joy</hi> is ſtill the <hi>predominant.</hi> So that at the worſt, they cannot be <hi>ſwallowed</hi> up of <hi>ſorrow,</hi> becauſe the ſorrow is ſo ſoon ſwallowed up of joy.</p>
            <p>Having ſhewed you <hi>why</hi> you are to goe the journey, and what <hi>manner of way</hi> you have, and what the <hi>fruit</hi> of the journey will be: Now that I have removed the <hi>rubs</hi> alſo, it remaines (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I have not been idle as to this work in my anſwers to the objections) that I put on

            <p>Chriſtians, it is ſtrange to me, not to ſee you <hi>merry,</hi> when you are <hi>doing well.</hi> For if you are <hi>willing</hi> to doe what you doe; I doe not ſee how you can be <hi>ſad</hi> in the <hi>doing;</hi> unleſs you can be <hi>unwilling,</hi> when you are willing.

Nay what a madneſs is it for you, firſt, to render your acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unpleaſing (nay diſpleaſing) to God, and more tedious to your ſelves: and afterwards to loſe not only your <hi>labour,</hi> when you have made it more then needed, but the <hi>reward</hi> of the actions alſo, which is ſo much, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's <hi>good will</hi> which is moſt of all.</p>

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:119702:156"/>merry,</hi> &amp; <hi>making merry</hi> (as they uſe to call it) I have allowed you freely of the firſt; but I ſhall be very ſparing to you in the laſt, as it is commonly uſed. 'Tis enough for <hi>wicked</hi> men, who have none of thoſe comforts either without them, or within them, which you have; to <hi>make</hi> themſelves merry: and therefore it is, that they uſe ſo many helps and meanes, and deviſe ſo many tricks to doe it. You for your part have no need to doe ſo. You <hi>are ſufficient of your ſelves</hi> to be <hi>merry;</hi> and you <hi>have</hi> ſufficient beſides your ſelves, to make you merry without any force, or labour of your own. You know what <hi>making merry</hi> meanes, and what the faſhion of the world is, <hi>viz:</hi> to <hi>paſs</hi> away their time with ſports, to ſing and play away their cares with wanton ſongs, and dances, and drown their ſorrowes in the cup, which they will have the <hi>deeper,</hi> that they may doe it the better. But you, I am ſure, have <hi>other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe learned Criſt.</hi> For neither are you allowed if you cannot be merry otherwiſe, to uſe ſuch meanes, or if you can, to expreſs it ſo.</p>
            <p>As I ſaid firſt, ſo I ſay ſtill, you may, and muſt be joyfull; but <hi>in the Lord:</hi> As <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid (upon thoſe words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſal: 97, 12, <hi>Jucundamini Juſti, Rejoyce ye righteous.</hi>) <hi>Forte fideles audientes jucundamini convivia me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditantur; calices praeparantur. Sed vide quid ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur; In domino, Happily, the righteous, hearing
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:119702:156"/>and the words, Be merry,</hi> may <hi>think upon feaſting, and provide their cups, and the like. But look what followes,</hi> IN THE LORD. It muſt be no otherwiſe then ſo. All that I would have you doe, is, that ſince you can ſpeak of ſo much <hi>joy,</hi> and <hi>comforts,</hi> and <hi>delights</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt within you;</hi> you would alſo make it appeare, <hi>without</hi> you; and let others know ſo much by your carriage and behaviour; that ſo they ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you thus, may think the better of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, <hi>&amp; glorifie your father which is in heaven,</hi> when they ſee his children are not neglected.</p>
            <p>So on the otherſide, I doe not ſay, but there is a <hi>time</hi> (as the Preacher ſaith) to <hi>weepe,</hi> as well as to <hi>laugh;</hi> a time to be <hi>ſad,</hi> and to have a <hi>ſad countenance.</hi> A man may, no doubt <hi>grieve:</hi> For Chriſt himſelfe did ſo. But to <hi>make ones ſelfe ſad,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hilary</hi> denies it, and ſaith he did not <hi>dolere,</hi> but only <hi>pati impetum,</hi> which <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> reprovs him for.</note> and to <hi>be of a ſad countenance,</hi> as if that were the proper and inſeparable marke of a mortified man, or as if that were the temper he muſt needs be of: it is a thing no way to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Chriſtian, and that which our Saviour long agoe condemned for the trick of a <hi>hypocrite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo much for <hi>exhortation.</hi> A word of <hi>reproofe,</hi> &amp; I have done. Of <hi>reproofe,</hi> I ſay, both to him that thinks he cannot <hi>be</hi> a Chriſtian,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:119702:157"/>unleſs he be ſad: and to him that thinks he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>thought</hi> to be ſo, unleſs he <hi>look</hi> ſo. For ſhame leave off ſobbing and ſighing, like men <hi>without hope.</hi> Doe not diſgrace the maſter whom you ſerve, and make the world believe you are overlabour'd, and hardly uſed. Be not like the dog in the manger, that would neither eate hay himſelfe, nor ſuffer the horſe to eate any. Be not longer an hinderance of your brethrens joy. And be no longer a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, and a ſtumbling block in the way, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch as are comming to the ſervice of Chriſt; and yet ſerve him never a jot the better your ſelves, but the worſe. If you are diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, tell me what aileth you. I am ſure, you have more then heart can wiſh, or conceive, For <hi>neither hath eye ſeen, nor eare heard, neither have entred into the heart of man to conceive, the things that God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> 1 Cor: 2.9. If you regard not your own good; however doe not give your enemies oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to rejoyce, or think that your conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is worſe then theirs. I would be <hi>merry,</hi> ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if it were but to <hi>outvy</hi> them. What? ſhall a <hi>wicked man</hi> comfort himſelfe in a poore <hi>barn full of corne,</hi> and ſay, rejoycing, <hi>Soule; thou haſt much goods layd up for many yeares: take thine eaſe, eate, drink, and be merry,</hi> And haſt thou nothing to ſay, that art an <hi>heire</hi> to no leſſe <hi>eſtate,</hi> then the <hi>Kingdome of Heaven?</hi> Shall
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:119702:157"/>a <hi>naturall man,</hi> and a <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> and a <hi>Stoick,</hi> brag that nothing can make him grieve: and ſhall a <hi>Spirituall</hi> man, and a <hi>Believer,</hi> and a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> complaine, that nothing can make him <hi>merry?</hi> If you can endure ſuch a diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of your religion, you can endure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing.

               </q> I muſt crave your reading to judge, and your patience to reade, what I ſhall ſay concerning a <hi>wicked life.</hi> Seeing <hi>David</hi> bids us not <hi>be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious againſt the workers of iniquity</hi> Pſal: 37.1.

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:119702:159"/>into the <hi>nature,</hi> and propertyes; and examine the <hi>cauſes</hi> of it. If I can proove their <hi>joy</hi> to be <hi>leſſe</hi> in <hi>quantity,</hi> and <hi>worſe</hi> in <hi>quality;</hi> their <hi>ſorrow</hi> to be <hi>more,</hi> and <hi>worſe;</hi> and their <hi>condition</hi> to be abſolutely <hi>worſe,</hi> and to have much more <hi>cauſe</hi> of <hi>ſorrow,</hi> then the <hi>godly mans condition;</hi> and no cauſe at all of <hi>joy:</hi> I hope I ſhall not looſe my labour, but obtaine my deſire of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading you, not to trouble your ſelves as you <hi>doe,</hi> at the <hi>ſight</hi> of their but <hi>ſeeming:</hi> but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce as you <hi>ſhould,</hi> in the enjoyment of your own <hi>truly happy condition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt then, whereas the <hi>joy</hi> of the <hi>godly,</hi> (or the <hi>godly joy</hi>) is <hi>continuall,</hi> i.e. <hi>uninterrupted,</hi> and <hi>continuall,</hi> i.e. <hi>laſting,</hi> (nay, <hi>everlaſting</hi>) The <hi>joy</hi> which the <hi>wicked</hi> have, (or the <hi>wicked joy;</hi> for ſo moſt of it is) is but <hi>momentany;</hi> either ſo that it is <hi>interrupted</hi> with one thing or other; coming, and going, upon fits, and flaſhes: or ſo, that, if it ſhould be without interruptions, it would not be long, ere it would be no more. For, indeed, it is ſo <hi>weak,</hi> and like an abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive child; that it doth not onely not live out all this life, which is but a <hi>moment</hi> compard with <hi>eternity;</hi> but very ſeldome holds out longer then a <hi>moment</hi> of this<note n="*" place="margin">Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon</hi> Job, c. <hi>20. compares it thus;</hi> Gaudium <hi>(ſayes he)</hi> hypocrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum inſtar puncti in puncto enim ſtylus-ut ponitur, levatur, apppa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret ad momentum, ſed deſpuret in perpetuum.</note>

            <p>A <hi>wicked</hi> man has as bad a <hi>tenure</hi> of any thing that he has, as any <hi>Villaine'</hi> can have in an eſtate: <hi>uncertaine</hi> and <hi>unſtable; in</hi> to day, and <hi>out</hi> to morrow: Every thing <hi>ſudden,</hi> and <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhnig,</hi> and gone in an inſtant.

He ſhall leane upon his houſe, but it ſhall not ſtand: he ſhall hold it faſt but it ſhall not endure. He is green before the ſun, and his branch ſhooteth forth in his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. His roots are wrapped about the heap, and ſeeth the place of ſtones. If he deſtroy him from his place, then it ſhall deny him, ſaying, I have not ſeen thee. Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth ſhall others grow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as all other his good things (as he eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teems them to be) ſo his <hi>joy</hi> eſpecially. If it be <hi>ſweet,</hi> its ſure to be <hi>ſhort;</hi> ſcarce enduring time enough to be taken. Moſt of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts make him but as happy as <hi>Tantalus; bob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing</hi> him in the mouth, and touching him no longer, then only to make him <hi>long,</hi> and away. At the beſt, and the longeſt, his <hi>joy</hi> endures but for a night (the only time for <hi>theeves,</hi> and <hi>drunkards,</hi> and ſuch like: though I know, how <hi>ſad,</hi> and <hi>fearfull</hi> their <hi>night-mirth</hi> alſo is) but his <hi>ſorrow cometh in the morning</hi> (no leſſe ſure, and no more in his power to hinder, then the riſing of the Sun) and takes the whole day before it.</p>
            <pb n="316" facs="tcp:119702:160"/>
            <p>And So, moſt of his <hi>pleaſures,</hi> in which his <hi>joy</hi> is, hold but the laſting of a <hi>taſt,</hi> and a <hi>touch:</hi> viz. ſo long as his meat, and his drink is paſſing thorow. How few of his <hi>delights</hi> out-live one <hi>thought!</hi> And how few of his <hi>thoughts</hi> upon his <hi>delights,</hi> live till one <hi>thought</hi> upon another be paſt! He is ſcarce ever able to have two <hi>merry thoughts</hi> together, and never a ſad <hi>one</hi> betweene. Perhaps, this moment, he thinks himſelfe in heaven (for ſo meanly does he think of it, and ſo badly is he acquainted with it, as to compare any thing to it) for enjoying ſuch or ſuch a boon. But let him think againe; and tis a thouſand to one, but he <hi>repents.</hi> His <hi>joy runs</hi> no longer then it <hi>raines;</hi> while the <hi>weather</hi> and <hi>times</hi> are good. It has no <hi>conſtant fountain,</hi> as the godly mans has. Perhaps it may be <hi>ſtrong,</hi> &amp; <hi>violent</hi> at firſt: &amp; ſo uſually thoſe motions are, that are of ſhort continuance. It may make a great <hi>cry:</hi> and ſo many other things doe, when there is little, or no <hi>wooll.</hi> Tis like the valour of the <hi>Inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brian Gaules,</hi> of which <hi>L. Florus</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut primus impetus iis major quam virorum eſt: ita ſequens minor quam faeminarum. The firſt onſet was more then manlike; but all the reſt leſſe then woman-like.</hi> It may make a great <hi>flame:</hi> but it will be but like the flame of ſtraw, or <hi>thornes,</hi> or a <hi>ſquib of powder.</hi> It will mount up high, ſo that every one ſhall ſee it; and
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:119702:160"/>make a great crackling ſo that all the towne ſhall heare it, but it will be quickly out (as moſt other things are quickly ended, that are quickly begun) and beſides the little benefit it does by his heat or Light, Leaves a ſtinch behind it.</p>
            <p>And It muſt needs be ſo; unleſſe the man had either more <hi>fewell,</hi> or ſuch as would laſt longer. For his <hi>proſperity,</hi> (and that he knowes himſelfe; which makes his <hi>joy, ſad</hi> and <hi>fearfull</hi>) is exceeding fickle: Perhaps, long comming, and uſually ſoone going. like the <hi>morning dew,</hi> a little heat will make it fall, and any thing will ſhake it to the ground. He <hi>cannot</hi> have a longer eſtate in it, then for his life at beſt. For the moſt part, he has but a few yeares: many times a few daies: ſometimes a few howres: and <hi>conſtantly</hi> at the will of an <hi>unconſtant fortune.</hi> If it does laſt all his life long; yet it does not laſt <hi>long:</hi> for his life is but <hi>ſhort,</hi> when it is longeſt; and it is more like to be <hi>ſhorter,</hi> then <hi>longer;</hi> and then how ſhort is it! His <hi>proſperity</hi> he and ſuch as he is, doe but <hi>call</hi> it ſo; and ſo it may paſſe here amongſt men (as a piece of leather may paſſe for a piece of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, if men will have it ſo; and a piece of braſſe may paſſe for, and pleaſe a child as well as gold) but it will not goe for ſuch in another world, and he has no hopes to have any other in exchange.</p>
            <pb n="318" facs="tcp:119702:161"/>
            <p>He hath his <hi>portion in this life.</hi> And he is both able, and likely, to <hi>ſpend</hi> it, and <hi>loſe</hi> it, and be <hi>taken</hi> from it in the twinkling of an eye: And then what will he doe? He hath all that he was to have all ready; and there is nothing <hi>to come:</hi> No <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Indeed, the <hi>wicked,</hi> many of them, in regard of their flouriſhing condition in this kinde of <hi>proſperity</hi> are as the <hi>growing graſſe.</hi> But it is but the graſſe that <hi>growes upon the houſe tops.</hi> of which the<note n="*" place="margin">Let them be as the graſſe upon the houſetops, which withereth before it grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up; wherewith the mower filleth not his hand, nor he that bindeth ſheaves his boſome.</note> Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 129 6, 7. viz. that <hi>wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before it be plucked up;</hi> and wherewith the Angels, which are the reapers, ſhall never fill their hand to put them into God's barne: for they are ſure to be <hi>burnt.</hi> I may ſay, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

Wherewith ſhould a <hi>wicked</hi> man encounter with <hi>adverſity?</hi> The beſt weapon for ſuch an uſe, muſt be a <hi>ſtrong ſoule</hi> (for a <hi>ſtrong body</hi> oppoſed to <hi>miſeryes,</hi> is but a great heap of wood to a <hi>flame</hi> of <hi>fire</hi>) but alas, his ſoule is ſo ſick with ſin; that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteed of eaſing him of his burden, it will adde more weight, and preſſe him lower to the ground. But I will not ſpeake much of <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity,</hi> leſt <hi>wicked</hi> men tell me, I may ſpare my labour, they are not ſo much troubled with it.

            <pb n="326" facs="tcp:119702:165"/>
            <p>Nay not only their <hi>end</hi> hereafter; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>interuption</hi> of their condition while they are here, is ſo much the worſe.

            <p>But to returne to the wicked mans <hi>Joy.</hi> Give me leave to mention a few reaſons, why a <hi>wicked</hi> man's <hi>mirth</hi> (that which he has) is ſo ſhort liv'd. My reaſons ſhall be drawne. 1. From the <hi>Abundance of helps</hi> which it needs, and from the <hi>weakneſſe,</hi> and <hi>fullibility</hi> of thoſe helps 2. From its <hi>imperfection,</hi> both in regard of its <hi>ſubject,</hi> and <hi>object,</hi> and alſo in its owne <hi>nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt viz: the <hi>Abundance of helps</hi> which it needs 1. It <hi>depends</hi> much on the <hi>company of men;</hi> wherein be cannot alwaies have his mind (&amp; yet otherwiſe, he cannot be <hi>merry</hi>) For ſtill one thing or other is <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe.</hi> Either he <hi>wants company,</hi> or he has <hi>too much,</hi> or <hi>too little,</hi> or ſuch as does not <hi>agree</hi> with his <hi>humour.</hi> If the fault be one of theſe three laſt; he may, perhaps, ſcrabble out with a great deale of paine. But if it be the firſt; he has no ſhift to make. For he has ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>objects</hi> without him, to tempt him, and vexe him, which he cannot <hi>put off;</hi> ſuch a <hi>lowd importune noyſe</hi> within him <hi>viz:</hi> of a <hi>troubled conſcience</hi> continually upbrading him, which he cannot <hi>appeaſe;</hi> finally, ſuch diſturbance, from his thoughts to, or for, the committing of ſinne, which he cannot <hi>remedy;</hi> that if you put
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:119702:166"/>him to ſingle <hi>mirth,</hi> he is no body. If you keep him but <hi>within doores</hi> never ſo little; he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently <hi>off the hinges;</hi> and like a thing, as I may ſay, <hi>unhang'd:</hi> dull, &amp; unweildy, and without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny activity at all.</p>
            <p>Certainly, that <hi>clock</hi> is not good, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not goe <hi>long,</hi> after it is ſet a going: whoſe <hi>hand</hi> will goe no longer, then it has the helping hand of another to keep it going. Even ſuch another thing is a <hi>wicked mans joy.</hi> The <hi>joy</hi> of a godly man is cleane contrary; becauſe, he has ſo little need of forrein aſſiſtance; being ſo well furniſh'd at home, and able to live of himſelfe. You may not think to make him <hi>ſad,</hi> by making him <hi>ſolitary;</hi> who has moſt of <hi>God,</hi> when he has leaſt of <hi>men;</hi> and is never leſſe alone, then when you think him to be ſo.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It <hi>depends</hi> much upon the <hi>ſtate</hi> of his <hi>body.</hi> He is <hi>merry,</hi> either becauſe he is of a <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine complexion;</hi> and ſo his mirth can be but a <hi>humour,</hi> at beſt, &amp; of an <hi>uncertaine conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance;</hi> being that which proceeds from a <hi>humour,</hi> which muſt be <hi>ſupplyed,</hi> and may be <hi>corrupted,</hi> &amp; will <hi>runne away</hi> at the leaſt hole in a veine. Or elſe, becauſe he is in a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>health,</hi> and <hi>ſtrength;</hi> and ſo his <hi>mirth</hi> muſt needs be as his <hi>body</hi> is; viz. ſeldome <hi>ſound, quickly diſturbed,</hi> and <hi>eaſily deſtroyed.</hi> Keep ſuch a one but from a meales meat: or give him a morſell too much: hurt him in one of his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:119702:166"/>or let him have but a little <hi>dumpiſh</hi> wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; how does he ſit mourning like an owle, and knows not how to be comforted! His <hi>laughing</hi> is preſently turned into <hi>howling,</hi> and <hi>ſighing,</hi> his <hi>harp</hi> into <hi>mourning,</hi> and his <hi>organ into the voyce of them that weep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It <hi>depends</hi> much upon his <hi>age.</hi> As his <hi>mirth dyes</hi> with him; ſo it <hi>grows old</hi> with him, and decayes, as he does. There is ſeldome a <hi>wicked man,</hi> but his <hi>gray haires</hi> are <hi>brought downe</hi> with <hi>ſorrow to the grave: Sorrow</hi> for <hi>paine:</hi> and <hi>Sorrow</hi> (ſuch as it is) for <hi>Sinne;</hi> and <hi>Sorrow</hi> that he <hi>cannot be merry.</hi> Every thing that he has <hi>been,</hi> he cannot think of it without <hi>ſorrow:</hi> either that he <hi>was</hi> ſo, or that he cannot be ſo any longer, or that he has no longer time to be <hi>not</hi> ſo. How oft does he repeat it, ſighing, and ſhaking his head. <hi>I was, and I have been thus and thus: Thoſe daies are gone,</hi> or, <hi>It was a merry time with me the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> And So every thing that he has <hi>done,</hi> he cannot think of it but with ſorrow; at leaſt, he cannot be <hi>glad</hi> to think of it. If he were able to lay to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether before him, all the deeds that ever he did, all the words that ever he ſpake, all the thoughts that ever he conceiv'd, and all the objects too that ever entered into his ſences, or his underſtanding: he would not be able to extract out of them one dramme of Comfort, to exhilarate, and revive his diſconſolate droo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ſoule.</p>
            <pb n="330" facs="tcp:119702:167"/>
            <p n="4">4. It depends much, upon his <hi>meat</hi> and <hi>drink.</hi> His bones are never at eaſe, till his <hi>belly</hi> be full I will not give a pin for his <hi>mirth,</hi> if he be <hi>faſting.</hi> If he be hungry, and not preſently ſupply'd which meat; he is <hi>angry,</hi> and was piſh. As the frenſh-man ſays, <hi>A hungry Clowne,</hi> &amp;c: ſo may I ſay, a <hi>hungry wicked man,</hi> is <hi>halfe mad.</hi> And yet if he is not hungry, he will be angry then too, and ſad for want of a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack. When he is empty, he would be full: and when he is full, he would be empty. He will be ſad, becauſe he <hi>cannot</hi> eate: and he will be ſad, becauſe he can eate no more. He has more then enough to doe, to pleaſe his taſt, and the reſt of the ſences: and yet he knowes not what to doe, if he doe not. Deny the <hi>merrieſt epicure</hi> ſuch a diſh, or ſuch a ſawce: or let him want but his wine, and tobacco: and who ſo <hi>melancholy</hi> a body, as this <hi>merry ſoule.</hi> Beleeve it, ſuch a mans <hi>mirth</hi> is, for the moſt part, but <hi>drowning of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> upon times and tides. For when the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is gone, and the drink is all up, and downe: his mirth is <hi>upon the head,</hi> his <hi>joy</hi> is at an <hi>ebbe;</hi> and, like bankes that have been overflowne, there is none ſo <hi>muddy</hi> as he.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A Second fault in a <hi>wicked</hi> man's <hi>joy</hi> is, that it is <hi>imperfect.</hi> And ſo it is, in regard both of the <hi>ſubject,</hi> and the <hi>object.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="331" facs="tcp:119702:167"/>
            <p n="1">1. In regard of the <hi>ſubject</hi> that has it: viz: becauſe it is but in one part of the man, and that the worſt too, the body; and not in the ſoule: and in the worſt part of the body, the <hi>outer</hi> part; and not in the <hi>heart.</hi> or if at the beſt, it be in the <hi>Soule;</hi> it is but in a <hi>part</hi> of that neither, and the worſt part thereof too; even as farre as it is <hi>carnall,</hi> or <hi>naturall,</hi> and not a jot further, or higher. But it is ſeldome ſo neither: and therefore it can hardly be ſaid to be <hi>in</hi> the man, or to have any depth in it; and conſequently, a man cannot be truly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with it.

            <p>I ſay, a wicked man's joy in regard of its <hi>ſubject,</hi> is as <hi>groſſe,</hi> and <hi>earthly:</hi> (remaining in the members of the body,) As in regard of the <hi>cauſe,</hi> it is <hi>aërie,</hi> and <hi>vain:</hi> (beginning, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing upon light occaſions:) ſo that it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>pure</hi> enough to pierce ſo farre as the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> nor <hi>weighty</hi> enough to ſinke to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the <hi>heart.</hi> Any <hi>ſtranger</hi>

               <pb n="332" facs="tcp:119702:168"/>but a <hi>Cheerefull countenance</hi> will not make a merry <hi>Heart.</hi> His <hi>heart</hi> is ſo farre from the <hi>objects</hi> of his <hi>joy</hi> (which are <hi>groſſe,</hi> and <hi>earthly</hi> things, that cannot get to it) and the <hi>objects</hi> of <hi>vexations</hi> ſo <hi>neere</hi> his <hi>conſcience;</hi> and his <hi>conſcience</hi> ſo neere his heart; that he can never be <hi>heartily merry.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, he may be <hi>pleaſantly touched,</hi> and <hi>tickl'd</hi> on the <hi>outſide</hi> of his <hi>heart:</hi> and ſo he may have a little <hi>forced mirth</hi> for a while; as a ſick man, or an old man may have by the ſtrength of a potion, or a cup of liquour: But I doe not remember, that ever I read, or heard; and I beleeve, he cannot ſay it himſelfe, that <hi>joy</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into his <hi>heart,</hi> and that his <hi>heart</hi> was <hi>enlarged</hi> with it, ſo that his very <hi>ſpirit</hi> rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; (ſo as the <hi>godly man's uſes</hi> to doe, and as the Scriptures teſtifie of him every where.) He lookes merrily without, like a whited ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher: but <hi>within</hi> there is a ſad ſight of dead men's bones; of a dead heart, and a dead con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and a whole ſoule dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.

            <p>And truly, even ſo the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of a <hi>wicked</hi> man (that which is of moſt conſequence, and he thinks not of it: and that which, let him uſe it how he will, will live however, and cannot dye) is <hi>ſad,</hi> and <hi>hungry,</hi> and ready to ſtarve for want: while the fleſh, and the members of the body, are glutted, and not ſo much delighted, as ſated, and ſadded, (while they ſeeme to be gladded) with abundance of pleaſures. As, <hi>plus dolet qui quod intus eſt dolet:</hi> ſo, <hi>plus gaudet qui quod intus eſt gaudet.</hi> For what is ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the legs, ſtretching abroad of the <hi>jaws,</hi> and making a noyſe with the throat (wherein there is paine, and wearineſſe; and which are as <hi>ſuddenly</hi> ended, as they are <hi>vainly</hi> begun, and <hi>violently</hi> proſecuted) to a <hi>well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, quiet, undiſturbed, endleſſe, joy of the ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Joy is <hi>better enjoyd</hi> by the <hi>ſpirit:</hi> and the <hi>joy</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> is <hi>better,</hi> and <hi>more.</hi> It is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with leſſe <hi>feare</hi> and <hi>diſturbance:</hi> but in more <hi>abundance.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. A <hi>wicked man's joy</hi> is <hi>imperfect</hi> in regard of the <hi>object</hi> too.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is <hi>corporeall.</hi> And ſo it is the leſſe wonder, that his pleaſure is but <hi>corporeall</hi> for the <hi>ſubject;</hi> while the <hi>objects</hi> of it are no other, ſuch as <hi>meate,</hi> and <hi>drink,</hi> &amp; monyes, and the like. For ſuch things as theſe, being <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall,</hi> and of a <hi>groſſe ſubſtance,</hi> it is impoſſible, they ſhould come <hi>neere</hi> enough to the <hi>ſoule,</hi> which is ſpirituall, and of a pure ſuſtance, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>place</hi> and <hi>being,</hi> or in <hi>pleaſing,</hi> and <hi>being liked</hi> as to make it fully, and <hi>intimately,</hi> and thorowly glad.</p>
            <p>Nothing is ſuffered to be <hi>neere</hi> another thing in <hi>ſituation,</hi> that is altogether of another kind: and nothing is <hi>lik'd</hi> or ſuffered to be <hi>neer</hi> in <hi>affection;</hi> which neither is nor can be made <hi>like,</hi> to that which is to <hi>like</hi> or to <hi>love</hi> it. Things that <hi>love</hi> one another, would even <hi>be</hi> one another, (as we uſe to ſay, <hi>Amicus alter idem, a freind is another ſelfe</hi>) for <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>deſire</hi> are ſuch ſtrong affections, that they will never leave clipping, and embracing, and joyning the thing that is lov'd, to the thing that loves; till,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:119702:169"/>imitating nature in her operation, they have made it almoſt one with it, and in a manner tranſform'd it into the ſame thing. For thus it is with a godly man, and the <hi>objects</hi> of his love, <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who are all one in the other, and one with one another, as Chriſt ſaid <hi>I am in the father, and the father in me, and you in me and I in you.</hi> Inſomuch that a <hi>godly man's joy,</hi> having <hi>ſuch objects,</hi> which may be <hi>ſo enjoy'd;</hi> muſt needs be <hi>perfect,</hi> &amp; without defect.</p>
            <p>Now if the <hi>Soule (or the mind)</hi> love ſuch <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> as theſe (as it cannot doe, if it be it's ſelfe, and in it's right <hi>mind:</hi> not mad, nor <hi>drunck,</hi> nor ſet beſides it ſelfe with paſſion) all that it could do, would be only this, even create the more trouble to her ſelfe, in loving, and deſiring that which ſhe is not able to enjoy: even as much trouble and paine, as it is for any one to love that which he cannot eate; or a woman with child, to be ſtill longing for what can never be gotten; or a man, to ſtrike at a ball with all his might and miſſe of his blow. And yet on the other ſide, if the <hi>Soule</hi> do <hi>not</hi> love ſuch <hi>objects;</hi> her vexation is all as much to have them alwaies offer'd to her, ſo as they are. 'Tis an equall miſery, to love nothing but that which I cannot have; &amp; to have nothing, but that which I cannot love. How miſerably is the <hi>Soule</hi> of a <hi>wicked man,</hi> eith r pined with want of food; or vexed with ſuch as it cannot eate!
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:119702:170"/>Poore <hi>ſoule!</hi> that muſt take all the paine, and canſt have none of the pleaſure.

Canſt thou, and muſt thou, take care and provide for all <hi>their</hi> not only neceſſities, but pleaſures; and in the meane while muſt thou ſit alone thy ſelfe, as if thou wert <hi>no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> (as thou art not) <hi>ſad,</hi> and <hi>hungry,</hi> and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected: kept in a fooles paradiſe, and in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as long as thou art here, (a priſon too well loved by thee, and ſupported by thine wone care) and yet to be condemned for ever to another hereafter for thy labour. Truly, truly, I muſt needs ſay, thy condition is <hi>ſlaviſh,</hi> and <hi>miſerable;</hi> and thou maiſt well <hi>cry</hi> out, <hi>Woe is me that I have my habitation in the tabernacle of the body, and in</hi> theſe <hi>tents of Kedar.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Imperfection of a wicked mans joy in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the <hi>object</hi> (it being ſuppos'd, that the true <hi>ſubject</hi> of <hi>joy,</hi> which is the <hi>Soule,</hi> is <hi>incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible</hi>) is this, that the <hi>object</hi> is <hi>corruptible</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>good</hi> enough, nor <hi>great</hi> enough, nor <hi>laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> enough, for ſuch an <hi>excellent, glorious, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting</hi> creature, as the <hi>ſoule</hi> is, to rejoyce in. They ſay, a horſe will never <hi>prove,</hi> where he hath not a <hi>full bite (his unſatiſfiedneſſe,</hi> and his <hi>longing,</hi> does him more hurt then is meat
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:119702:170"/>does him good: ſo the ſoule, if it have only a little <hi>ſlender corruptible</hi> food; if it have no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diet, or entertainent in the body then ſo: it may ſeem to <hi>live;</hi> but it will ſecretly <hi>Conſume,</hi> and <hi>pine;</hi> and with eating food too long that is not fit for her, at length loſe her ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack <hi>to better;</hi> and then dye to all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Corruptible objects</hi> to an <hi>incorruptible ſoule</hi> (eſpecially if it can have no other) are like weak meats to a <hi>ſtrong ſtomack:</hi> or, bad meats to a good ſtomack: which becauſe it muſt have ſome, and it has no other, does not reject them; &amp; by degrees may be brought to uſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conſtantly (as many by degrees are brought to a diet contrary to their nature) but then in the mean time, it turns the meats into ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and growes the <hi>weaker</hi> it ſelfe, for want of a <hi>ſtronger ſubject</hi> to work upon. So it is with the <hi>Soule</hi> in the uſe of this <hi>Corruptible</hi> food. It is ſo farre from being <hi>improved</hi> with it, that it proves the worſe: and not only <hi>abuſeth</hi> the creatures with too much miſpence: but <hi>wrongs</hi> her ſelfe with abundance of diſeaſes. I tell thee, thy ſoule muſt have otherguiſe food, if ever it think to <hi>grow;</hi> unleſſe it be to <hi>grow worſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An <hi>Incorruptible ſoule,</hi> is ſo farre from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatiſfi'd with any <hi>Corruptible</hi> things, ſo as to make her ſelfe <hi>merry</hi> in the enjoyment of
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:119702:171"/>them: that when ſhe has uſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, like a great ſtomack with a very little meat, ſhe grows more <hi>hungry;</hi> and conſequently more <hi>diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,</hi> and <hi>ſorrowfull.</hi> If it had <hi>no knowledge,</hi> nor <hi>ſenſe;</hi> it would never proſper, ſo long as it is ty'd to ſuch things as diſagree with the nature of it, or are a hinderance to that which does agree: no more then a vine, or any other plant, can grow neere that, which either has an <hi>antipathy</hi> to it, or hinders the influence of the ſun, or diverts its nouriſhment another way. How much leſſe then, having <hi>knowledge</hi> what thoſe <hi>Corruptible</hi> things are, how <hi>vaine</hi> and <hi>empty,</hi> and altogether <hi>unfit</hi> for her; is ſhe able to be <hi>merry</hi> in the enjoyment of them. How can I take full delight in that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, which I am ſure will leave me <hi>ſuddenly?</hi> Even the more delight I take in ſuch Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; the leſſe I take; for the thought that it will not continue.

            <p n="3">3 A third <hi>Imperfection</hi> in a <hi>wicked man's joy</hi> in regard of the <hi>object,</hi> is becauſe its <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> as they are of too <hi>ſhort continuance;</hi> ſo are they of too <hi>narrow extent,</hi> for ſuch a thing as the <hi>ſoule</hi> is, to be <hi>merry</hi> with.

               <hi>world,</hi> whether in heaven or earth, Spirits, &amp; Angells, and all.

Nothing but the <hi>feare of God,</hi> and ſuch <hi>wiſdome</hi> as that affords, will <hi>fill</hi> her. The <hi>rich man</hi> might brag as much as he would, and tell his <hi>ſoule, Soule thou haſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and Soule, thou art well enough,</hi> when his barne was full. But 'twas more then his <hi>ſoule</hi> would tell him, or was able to ſay her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. For if the whole world had been his barne, and a world of riches had been in his barne, and his barne been full to the brimm, alas poore wretch (and never ſo wretched as now) his empty ſoule all the while is ready to ſtarve, and die, and he feeles it not. I might ſay to him, as it was ſaid to <hi>Laodicea,</hi> Rev: 3.17. <hi>Thou ſaieſt I am rich, and increaſed with
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:119702:172"/>goods, and have need of nothing: and knoweſt not that thou art wretched, and miſerable, and poore and blind, and naked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, it may be (that which is worſe) by this time, by reaſon of long want of food, the <hi>ſoule's appetite</hi> is gone, and ſhe cannot <hi>deſire</hi> what ſhe ſhould have. She may be <hi>full:</hi> but 'tis as a veſſell that is empty of <hi>good liqour,</hi> and full with <hi>aire.</hi> She is full with <hi>wind,</hi> and <hi>vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> like a ſtomack that hath been kept faſting too long. She hath nothing, and ſhe is neither able, nor deſirous, to <hi>take</hi> any thing: and ſo her condition was never ſo dangerous, as now it is. Say, thy ſoule be <hi>full:</hi> yet it is not <hi>ſatisfied.</hi> And unleſſe there be a <hi>fullneſſe</hi> of <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> all other <hi>fullneſſe</hi> is but a <hi>burthen,</hi> and nothing worth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That is the fullneſſe which the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher meanes, Eccleſ: 6.3. <hi>If a man beget an hundred children, and live an hundred yeares ſo that the daies of his yeares be many; and his ſoule be not filled with good, and alſo that he have no buriall: I ſay that an untimely birth is better then he.</hi> Though thy ſoule have as much as it can have now, while it hath, what it hath: yet it hath not what it would have, if it were as it <hi>ſhould</hi> be; and what it could have, if it were not as it is. It is <hi>full,</hi> i. e. <hi>ſated,</hi> as a ſtomack <hi>overchargd</hi> with heavy meat, to ſickneſſe; but it is not full, i.e. <hi>ſatisfi'd,</hi> as a ſtomack refreſh'd with what is fitting, to alacrity, and content.
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:119702:172"/>Neither indeed, is it poſſible it ſhould be ſo, with ſuch <hi>heavy</hi> and <hi>light vanities,</hi> as theſe earthly goods are; which, like ſweet cates, <hi>cloy</hi> the ſtomack before they <hi>fill</hi> it, and <hi>fill</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they <hi>ſatisfy</hi> it. Theſe overluſhious dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>corruptible pleaſures, take away</hi> the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,</hi> before they <hi>ſatisfie</hi> the <hi>deſire.</hi> It was not for nothing, you muſt think, that David was ſo afraid to touch them, Pſal. 141.4. <hi>Incline not my heart to any evill thing to practiſe wicked workes, with men that worke iniquity: and let me not eate of their dainties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the worſt of it is, the <hi>ſoule,</hi> perhaps, is not <hi>full</hi> ſo neither. For if ſhe were, I believe ſhe would feele ſome paine; &amp; by this meanes be brought to take ſome courſe to be cur'd of of the diſtemper, and reſolve to be diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd, and glutted ſo no more.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſſe, the <hi>ſoule,</hi> being in this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a ſurfet, &amp; yet feeling no pain: the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the wicked man muſt needs be the more miſerable, and his <hi>ſoule</hi> the <hi>ſicker:</hi> even as the <hi>body</hi> is in the worſt condition, when it eats nothing but <hi>unwholeſome meat,</hi> and eats <hi>too much,</hi> and is not <hi>ſick</hi> with it neither. For feeling no paine, as long as ſhe can eate; ſhe keeps on her old diet: her diſeaſes encreaſe ſecretly, and ſo encreaſe the more; and ſhe continues eating poyſon, and knows it not. She is as one, who going the wrong way,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:119702:173"/>thinkes he is in the right: and that will make her goe on: and going <hi>faſt</hi> (becauſe ſhe is naturally <hi>quick,</hi> and haſty in going) ſhe goes the further in the leſſe time (ſo that ſhe has no time to deliberate and repent) and the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe goes, the more loath ſhe is to goe back againe, and take another courſe. Like a metalſome blind horſe, ſhe ſtumbles moſt dangerouſly now, while ſhe is in the way; and in the end of her journey throws her ſelfe irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably into the pit of deſtruction.</p>
            <p n="3">3 In the third and laſt place, <hi>wicked mens joy</hi> is <hi>imperfect,</hi> not only <hi>relatively</hi> in regard of the <hi>ſubject</hi> and the <hi>object,</hi> but in <hi>its ſelfe.</hi> And good enough for them. For ſithence what they doe, and what God ſhould have from them, is <hi>imperfect</hi> and not <hi>full</hi> (as it is ſaid of the people of Sardis, Rev. 3.2. that their workes were not <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>full,</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>) they muſt expect that what they have from God, muſt be imperfect too.

            </p>
            <p>Now the <hi>joy</hi> of a <hi>wicked man</hi> is imperfect in its ſelfe 1. becauſe it is not ſo as it ſeemes to be, or it is not <hi>ſincerely</hi> ſo. 'Tis not pure gold: but alloyd, and adulterated with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.

            <p>But neither is the <hi>wicked mans joy</hi> worſe then the <hi>godly man's phyſically</hi> only: but alſo <hi>morally.</hi> For 1. It is always <hi>ſinfull,</hi> and <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive to God;</hi> and ſo muſt needs be <hi>ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> one time or other, and cannot be <hi>true at</hi> any. 2. It is moſt commonly <hi>hurtfull,</hi> and <hi>offenſive to man</hi> viz: himſelfe, or others, or both, either by word or deed. Whereas a <hi>godly mans mirth</hi> is allways <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>harmeles,</hi> as well in it's owne iſſue, as the intention of the perſon.</p>
            <p>And no wonder, his <hi>joy</hi> is ſo <hi>bad</hi> which he
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:119702:175"/>has; when he has <hi>no cauſe</hi> of having any <hi>joy</hi> at all. And therefore the beſt I can ſay of the beſt of his mirth, being <hi>without cauſe</hi> (or <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>) is, that it is <hi>brutiſh.</hi> Like the horſe in the battell (not ſo much for want of <hi>feare,</hi> as for want of <hi>wit,</hi> or <hi>knowledge</hi> of the danger; or, as we ſay, <hi>without feare or wit</hi>) he runs <hi>bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and <hi>merrily</hi> on in the moſt <hi>ſlippery,</hi> and <hi>dangerous</hi> places. For all the ways of the wicked are <hi>ſlippery,</hi> and therefore <hi>dangerous.</hi> Nay, and <hi>dark</hi> beſides: as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſays (Pſa: 35.6. <hi>Let their way be dark and ſlippery and let the Angell of the Lord perſecute them</hi>) and ſo the more dangerous; viz: becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſeen that they are ſo. (As uſually thoſe things cannot, that have moſt hurt in them.)</p>
            <p>The <hi>wicked man</hi> is <hi>merry,</hi> as the <hi>bird</hi> is, that ſings in a cage; or the man that ſleeps upon <hi>the top of a maſt.</hi> For all that time that he is ſo merry as he ſeems; he is captivated, and <hi>taken alive</hi> by the devill, and knows not of it. He knows not, that there is no condition worſe then his. Nay, he knows not that there is a better, and that he might be ſet at liberty. Therefore, if he ſorrow not; tis not out of <hi>courage,</hi> but <hi>ſtupidity.</hi> His jollity, while he is going in the ways of ſin, which <hi>lead to the Chambers of death,</hi> is like that of the oxe, when he is going to the ſlaughter; or the bird, when
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:119702:176"/>he haſteth to the <hi>ſnare</hi> as the expreſſion is Prov: 7.22, 23. His laughter has but the <hi>name,</hi> &amp; <hi>likeneſſe</hi> of laughter. For it is both <hi>irrationall,</hi> and without <hi>cauſe:</hi> being like the laughter of a <hi>mad man,</hi> that is <hi>melancholy Ela</hi> (as they call it) or a ſick man that is deſperately ſick: not out of <hi>joy,</hi> but <hi>diſeaſe:</hi> ſuch as will make a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man weep to ſee it, becauſe he will judg him to be farre gone and paſt cure; that he has gone ſo farre that he knows not how farre he has gone, having loſt his way, and himſelfe too. Certainly, a man in priſon, and ſlavery (as every wicked man is) cannot be ſo <hi>galliard,</hi> as one that is at <hi>liberty;</hi> unleſſe he be ſo <hi>ſenceleſſe</hi> as one that is <hi>dead,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>dead-drunk.</hi> No more can a wicked man unleſſe he be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wicked; drunk with pleaſures, and quite dead in treſpaſſes and ſins: paſt feeling, and not having his <hi>ſenſes exerciſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the next place, as a <hi>wicked mans joy</hi> is <hi>little,</hi> and <hi>falſe,</hi> and he hath <hi>no cauſe</hi> to be <hi>joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:</hi> ſo his <hi>ſorrow</hi> is <hi>much,</hi> and <hi>true,</hi> and he hath <hi>infinite cauſe</hi> to be <hi>ſorrowfull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That his <hi>ſorrow</hi> is <hi>much,</hi> i.e. frequent, firſt there are <hi>Scriptures</hi> enough every where to <hi>witneſſe</hi> it. See one place eſpecially Pſalm:<note n="*" place="margin">Their ſorrows ſhall be multi. pliod, that haſten after another God: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.</note>16.4. 2. There is <hi>Experience</hi> enough to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt it. For moſt of his <hi>actions</hi> are <hi>ill done,</hi> i. e.
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:119702:176"/>in <hi>paſſion,</hi> and moſt of his <hi>daies</hi> are <hi>ill ſpent</hi> i.e. in <hi>ſinne.</hi> Either way, he muſt needs be <hi>vex'd.</hi> And his <hi>anger,</hi> and <hi>vexation</hi> is ſo much the more: becauſe it is with none but himſelfe.</p>
            <p>That his ſorrow is <hi>much</hi> i.e. <hi>great,</hi> and <hi>truly</hi> ſo, appeares. 1. Becauſe it it <hi>all ſorrow:</hi> Even a perfect heape of <hi>aſhes,</hi> and never a <hi>ſparke</hi> of <hi>joy</hi> to make him beare up. For whence ſhould be have it? It cannot be from <hi>without.</hi> For if he have never ſo little <hi>loſſe,</hi> or <hi>croſſe</hi> from thence, to make him <hi>ſad;</hi> he is preſently like a <hi>mad man;</hi> &amp; it is not all the <hi>reaſons,</hi> nor all the <hi>comfortable ſpeeches,</hi> nor all the <hi>freinds</hi> in the world, can perſwade him to <hi>patience;</hi> much leſſe to <hi>mirth.</hi> And from <hi>within</hi> he cannot have it, unleſſe the <hi>Spirit</hi> were his Comforter: Which he is not (but only to the godly.)</p>
            <p n="2">2. His <hi>ſorrow</hi> is <hi>great,</hi> and <hi>truly ſuch,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe it hath no joy <hi>in</hi> it, or <hi>with</hi> it; but becauſe it hath none to <hi>attend</hi> it. It does not <hi>beget joy;</hi> as a godly man's <hi>ſorrow</hi> doth: nor is <hi>recompenced</hi> with it, as his is. It neither <hi>produceth joy</hi> as the <hi>fruit,</hi> nor is <hi>paid</hi> with <hi>joy</hi> as the <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends.</hi> Nay he doth, or may, <hi>ſorrow for</hi> his <hi>ſorrow:</hi> as I have formerly told you, he does, or may for his <hi>joy.</hi> And if the fruit of his <hi>joy</hi> be <hi>ſorrow,</hi> can you expect, that the fruit of his <hi>ſorrow</hi> ſhould be <hi>joy?</hi> If his beſt tree bring forth bad fruit; what can he gather from the worſt? He may ſorrow for his <hi>joyes,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:119702:177"/>they were not ſuch as they ſhould be; (becauſe they did himſelfe hurt; or becauſe they were vaine, and could not doe him good) and he may ſorrow for his <hi>ſorrowes,</hi> becauſe they were ſuch as they ſhould not be, ie. <hi>ſinnes; offenſive</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>deſtructive</hi> to <hi>himſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. His ſorrow appeares to be <hi>great,</hi> and <hi>truly ſuch.</hi> Becauſe, it is <hi>remedileſſe;</hi> as moſt of his evills uſe to bee. Either he hath no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at all; or elſe (which is worſe then if he had none, becauſe it deludes and vexes a man with vaine hopes.) the remedies are too weake to <hi>prevaile.</hi> And hence follow thoſe <hi>impere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,</hi> and <hi>wiſhes</hi> uſuall with wicked men, <hi>Would I were dead;</hi> or <hi>would ſome one would knock me in the head,</hi> and the like. His <hi>remedies are</hi> ſo weak, that inſtead of lifting up his head with comfort, they bow him lower, and plung him deeper under water: ſo that he is as a man that catcheth at a reed, when he is almoſt drownded; and holds by that which is not ſtrong enough to hold him.</p>
            <p>As in other things, ſo eſpecially in this, the difference between a <hi>Godly man's joy,</hi> and a <hi>wicked man's,</hi> appeares to be very great, viz: that a Godly man <hi>his diſeaſe</hi> is <hi>ſinne,</hi> and <hi>ſorrow</hi> is his <hi>remedy.</hi> And therefore his ſorrow can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be remediles, becauſe it cannot want that which it cannot be without. Now there is no need of a remedy for the remedy, till the evill
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:119702:177"/>be remedied: &amp; then a godly man will remove it himſelfe, by <hi>applying</hi> the <hi>ſovereigne</hi> balme of the <hi>merits of Chriſt</hi> He muſt let the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plaiſter firſt have it's worke, before he apply another to heale it. When the <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Phyſick</hi> hath ſufficiently wrought to <hi>remove</hi> the <hi>humours:</hi> then, and not till then, is a man ready for a <hi>cordiall</hi> to <hi>reſtore</hi> the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</hi> Now, his diſeaſe which he is to cure with ſorrow, is ſo mortall, that there needs no other thing to produce joy, then <hi>curing</hi> the <hi>diſeaſe:</hi> Which being done by <hi>ſorrow,</hi> his <hi>ſorrow</hi> proves a cauſe of <hi>joy;</hi> and ſo he may be <hi>glad</hi> to be <hi>ſorry.</hi> To a <hi>wicked</hi> man <hi>ſorrow</hi> is a diſeaſe; and <hi>ſinne,</hi> (as <hi>drunkenneſſe, ſelf murder,</hi> and the like) the <hi>Phyſick</hi> that is uſually taken to <hi>cure</hi> it: One diſeaſe to cure another; which muſt needs make his condition <hi>deſperate.</hi> And yet ſo it is. The beſt help he hath, is to <hi>leſſen</hi> the <hi>paine</hi> for a <hi>while,</hi> and <hi>encreaſe</hi> the <hi>diſeaſe</hi> for <hi>ever.</hi> For he that ſeekes to <hi>cure ſorrow,</hi> by <hi>committing ſinne;</hi> ſhall then ceaſe to have ſorrow, when ſin ſhall ceaſe to be ſin; which it can as well doe, as not be the <hi>cauſe</hi> of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
            <p>Never <hi>blame,</hi> nor <hi>pitty</hi> a <hi>godly man</hi> for being <hi>ſorry,</hi> (if he be <hi>ſorry</hi> as I would have him.) For his <hi>ſorrow</hi> is both his <hi>duty,</hi> and his <hi>deſire.</hi> He <hi>ſhould</hi> be <hi>ſorry;</hi> and ſo he <hi>ought</hi> not: and he <hi>would</hi> be <hi>ſorry;</hi> and ſo he <hi>deſires</hi> not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:119702:178"/>it. A <hi>wicked</hi> man, when he is ſorry, would not be ſorry; and ſo ſeekes for a <hi>reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:</hi> And he <hi>ſhould</hi> not be ſorry (it being not for <hi>ſinne,</hi> for which a man ought only to be ſorry indeed) and ſo his ſorrow is ſin, and his ſinne is puniſhed with want of a remedy.</p>
            <p>But now, leſt you ſhould wonder at me, for ſaying the wicked have ſo many ſorrowes,<note place="margin">Cauſes of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe moſt men think the contrary, &amp; that they <hi>are not in trouble like other men; tis</hi> but naming ſome <hi>few cauſes,</hi>

The <hi>cauſes</hi> of a <hi>wicked man's ſorrow</hi> are for the moſt part, 1 (which aggravates the matter, and makes the ſorrow the greater) <hi>within,</hi> and from at home (the cauſes from without I have leſſe mind to ſpeak to, being puniſhments, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch as he thinks not of, or is not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer till hereafter, and which I cannot ſo plainly convince him of.)

            <p n="2">2.

            <p>I had once a mind, (and it were very eaſy) to ſhew you the <hi>vexations</hi> and <hi>ſorrows</hi> of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>vices;</hi> but If I ſhould goe about it, I am afraid of being too large, and I have done ſomewhat this<note n="*" place="margin">In my <hi>View</hi> of the <hi>Threats</hi>
               </note> way already, beſides a great deale to be had in Common places. I will only name two, becauſe the <hi>Scripture,</hi> ſpeaks of them to this purpoſe in ſuch a manner.</p>
            <p>And thoſe are 1. <hi>Covetuouſneſſe.</hi> 1 Tim: 6, 10. <hi>For the love of money is the root of all evill, which while ſome coveted, after they have erred from the faith, and pierced themſelves thorow with many ſorrows.</hi> 2. Drunkenneſſe, Prov: 23, 29.30. <hi>Who hath wo? who hath ſorrow? who hath contention? who hath babling? who hath wounds without cauſe? who hath redneſſe of eyes? They that
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:119702:180"/>tarry long at the wine, they that goe to ſeeke mixt wine.</hi> And can there be better fruit expected while there is a root continually in the hearts of wicked men, yeelding matter for nothing elſe? That which I mean is <hi>ſenſuality,</hi> &amp; being <hi>addicted</hi> to <hi>pleaſure. Pleaſure</hi> is either upon the <hi>remembrance,</hi> or the <hi>preſence,</hi> or the <hi>expectation</hi> of ſome good. Every one of theſe waies, hath the <hi>wicked</hi> man a multitude of <hi>ſorrows.</hi> If he love it, and never had it; it is impoſſible but he ſhould be vex'd. But whether ſo much, or ſo long, as if he <hi>have had</hi> it, and <hi>have</hi> it, and <hi>may have</hi> it; I queſtion. I thinke, there is more vexation, and ſadneſſe, where pleaſure is leaſt a ſtranger; then where there is a conſtant <hi>ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing griefe,</hi> and a cauſe of ſadneſſe. What ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of head, and lamentings that they are <hi>paſt,</hi> have wicked men upon the thought of pleaſures which they <hi>have had,</hi> and cannot have againe! Thoſe which they <hi>have,</hi> how are they troubl'd for want of this, and that, to make them compleat! And how are they troubl'd to thinke, that they cannot enjoy them long! that their <hi>power</hi> will not ſuit with their <hi>deſire,</hi> the <hi>creatures</hi> will not be <hi>ſufficient</hi> for their <hi>uſe,</hi> and the <hi>time</hi> will not <hi>tarry</hi> their <hi>leaſure!</hi> If they have pleaſures a <hi>comming,</hi> what paines to ſtand a tip-toe! what weariſome ſhouldering along of the time! what painfull wiſhings for the day, when it is night; and
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:119702:181"/>the night, when it is day, according to the time when they expect them!</p>
            <p>But there is one thing yet, which is more then all the reſt which I have hitherto menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, to hinder a <hi>wicked man</hi> from living a <hi>merry life:</hi> as being indeed one cord made of many, or one reſult, and effect, as the former was the root of a great many cauſes (although I confeſſe, it to be referr'd better to his <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> then his <hi>conditions</hi>) and that is a <hi>continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all fearefullneſſe,</hi> ariſing from the <hi>conſcience</hi> of thoſe <hi>vices,</hi> of which he is continually guilty. What an <hi>aguiſh diſcemper</hi> is ſuch a <hi>guilty</hi> man in continually! —<hi>tacitâ ſudant praecordia culpâ.</hi> How often doe fitts of cold-ſweat come upon the thoughts of <hi>Sinne, Death, Hell, Judgment,</hi> any thing. Let him thinke upon what he will and he is afraid. If he thinke upon <hi>God,</hi> he is afraid, becauſe he hath <hi>offended</hi> him. If he thinke upon <hi>man;</hi> he is afraid becauſe he hath <hi>wronged</hi> him. If he thinke upon the <hi>creatures;</hi> he is afraid, becauſe he hath <hi>abuſed</hi> them. And if he thinke upon <hi>himſelfe:</hi> he is afraid becauſe he himſelfe hath done all this. The <hi>ſhaking of a leafe,</hi> and the ſight of a ſhadow, is enough to make him <hi>ſhake,</hi> and <hi>tremble</hi> like <hi>a leafe. A dreadfull ſound is in his eares: in proſperity the deſtroyer ſhall come upon him.</hi> Job 15.21. He that feares not God, muſt needs feare <hi>every</hi>
               <pb n="359" facs="tcp:119702:181"/>thing elſe: and he that is afraid of every, thing how can he be merry with any thing?</p>
            <p>But is this all the <hi>cauſe</hi> of <hi>ſadneſſe,</hi> that a <hi>wicked man</hi> hath viz. to be troubled with <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and <hi>paſſions?</hi> No no. For, beſides his bad conditions, which are inward and <hi>domeſtick cauſes</hi> (abundantly enough to make him <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſad</hi>) he hath a bad <hi>condition</hi> too, and <hi>outward occaſions,</hi> infinite many more (which thoſe <hi>cauſes</hi> have brought him) to increaſe his ſorrow: ſuch a <hi>condition,</hi> as he cannot be merry if he doe but think upon it. (And yet ſuch as he cannot be happy, if he do not think upon it: for he muſt think upon it, if ever he think to get out of it) Now that you may ſee the <hi>badneſſe</hi> of a <hi>wicked</hi> mans <hi>condition</hi> (I ſhall but hint a little; for I meant not to ſpeak of it at all for reaſons above mention'd) Firſt read what Job ſaith of him cap. 18.5. to the end, and cap. 20.5. to the end. When you have read that, I will leave it to your owne judgment, whether his <hi>condition</hi> be not <hi>bad,</hi> and whether it be not impoſſible for him to be <hi>truly merry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next, to give you a word or two my ſelfe 1. He is ſo farre from <hi>Safety,</hi> (which, as I have formerly ſaid, is of great conſequence for a <hi>merry life</hi>) that he is in continuall danger. Job. 5.4. <hi>His children are farre from ſafety, and
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:119702:182"/>they are cruſhed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them.</hi> For, (what ever ſuch as he think to the contrary) where ever he goes, he is in danger of <hi>ſnares</hi> that are laid to catch him: ſo that having too <hi>much feare</hi> he muſt needs have too <hi>little confidence</hi> (a thing very neceſſary for this purpoſe) to be <hi>merry.</hi> And in this the godly man is exceedingly beyond him: as Solomon ſaith Prov: 29 6. <hi>In the tranſgreſſion of an evill man there is a ſnare: but the rightous both ſing and rejoyce.</hi> Where ever he is, he is in danger of falling, God himſelfe (who knows all places beſt) <hi>ſetting</hi> him in <hi>ſlippery</hi> (and dangerous) <hi>places.</hi> So the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt telleth us Pſal: 73.18. So that he neede not have <hi>pray'd,</hi> as he does elſewhere, <hi>Let their way be dark and ſlippery</hi> Pſalm: 52 6. Now the <hi>ways</hi> of <hi>wicked</hi> men being <hi>ſlippery,</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently <hi>ſmooth,</hi> and <hi>eaſy</hi> to the feete; ſo that they run along a great way before they ſtop with pleaſure, and ſport like boyes at a ſliding. But then, to counterpoiſe all this ſport; beſides the mixture of <hi>feare</hi> in the midſt of their ſport; if they fall, it is with a vengeance (as they ſay.) And they are apt to fall (or as bad) with the leaſt touch: being like <hi>chaffe,</hi> that cannot ſtand againſt the leaſt puff of wind Pſalm. 1.5.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>ways</hi> will ſeem <hi>faire,</hi> and <hi>ſafe,</hi> and the <hi>beſt wayes,</hi> to him that never ſaw any other, or never well viewed any. But not elſe. For
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:119702:182"/>if you doe but <hi>looke into the ſanctuary:</hi> you ſhall preſently ſee what they are. You ſhall ſee what the end of <hi>wicked men</hi> is, and the end of all their <hi>ways. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntill I went into the ſanctuary of God</hi> (untill I lok'd into the <hi>word</hi> of God, and conſidered his <hi>law</hi>) <hi>Then under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood I their end. Surely thou didſt ſet them in ſlippery places: thou caſtedſt them down into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Pſalm:</hi> 73, 17, 18. Now the <hi>end,</hi> you know, is <hi>all,</hi> in every thing. For what is a <hi>faire eaſy way;</hi> if it end there, where I would not be; or if it <hi>lead</hi> me <hi>out of the way?</hi> But then (as I have formerly ſaid) a <hi>wicked mans wayes,</hi> beſides that they are <hi>ſlippery,</hi> are <hi>dark</hi> too. And what <hi>ſad</hi> walking is it (beſides the <hi>toyle</hi> and <hi>vexation</hi>) in the <hi>dark.</hi> Prov: 14.9. <hi>The way of the wicked is as darkneſſe: they know not at what they ſtumble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A <hi>wicked man</hi> has <hi>many maſters,</hi> and <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſorts</hi> of <hi>maſters,</hi> and ſuch as are <hi>very bad.</hi> (If they were <hi>good;</hi> it were bad enough, in that they are <hi>many</hi>) <hi>viz:</hi> The <hi>devill,</hi> the <hi>world,</hi> and ſix hundred <hi>Luſts:</hi> Such <hi>maſters,</hi> as are (to him) for the moſt pars <hi>taſk-maſters:</hi> and ſuch <hi>taſke-maſters</hi> as are <hi>Egyptian taſk-maſters.</hi> For. 1. they are <hi>unreaſonable.</hi> They will require <hi>brick</hi> of him, when he has no <hi>ſtraw:</hi> Command him him to doe this and that, and make him <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet,</hi> and <hi>feare,</hi> and <hi>luſt,</hi> and <hi>hope,</hi> and be <hi>angry;</hi> when there is no poſſibility to <hi>obtaine,</hi> or
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:119702:183"/>
               <hi>voyd,</hi> or be reveng'd. Which muſt needs put him to a great deale of <hi>torture,</hi> and <hi>vex</hi> him exceedingly. 2. They are <hi>unanſwerable: im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious, and importunate.</hi> They will not be <hi>put off.</hi> They will have their commands ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, what ever come of it, preſently, to the full, and every one, though they be never ſo contrary to reaſon and to one another: or elſe he ſhall never be quiet (And ſhall he be quiet ſo?) 3. As their commands are <hi>unreaſonable,</hi> and <hi>imperious:</hi> ſo they are <hi>continuall,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermiſſion. 'Tis not <hi>company,</hi> nor <hi>want</hi> of <hi>company:</hi> not <hi>opportunity,</hi> nor <hi>want</hi> of <hi>oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runity,</hi> to doe what God would have him: 'Tis not <hi>night,</hi> nor <hi>day:</hi> Not <hi>ſleeping,</hi> nor <hi>watching:</hi> Not being in <hi>publick,</hi> nor being in <hi>private:</hi> Not any <hi>time</hi> nor <hi>place,</hi> nor <hi>perſon,</hi> nor <hi>thing,</hi> that will make the <hi>devill,</hi> or his <hi>Luſts,</hi> forbeare <hi>tempting</hi> him one minute of an houre. And what <hi>domineering</hi> manner of <hi>tempting</hi> is it, wherewith they tempt <hi>a wicked</hi> man! But 4. there is one thing more in this tyranny which the <hi>devill</hi> and the <hi>fleſh</hi> have over a <hi>wicked man,</hi> that makes it <hi>intolerable:</hi> and that is this, that it is to be obeyed in <hi>ſeverally ways;</hi> extending it ſelfe both to <hi>body,</hi> and <hi>ſoule.</hi> They will be <hi>ſerved</hi> with <hi>all</hi> the <hi>ſoule,</hi> and with <hi>all</hi> the <hi>body:</hi> which is more then God himſelfe (to whom only our <hi>ſervice</hi> is due) neceſſarily requires (for if the ſpirit be doing, it will ſuffice when
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:119702:183"/>the <hi>body</hi> cannot.) But this they doe: and that with the <hi>inevitable hurt</hi> now, and <hi>neceſſary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi> hereafter, of both <hi>body,</hi> &amp; <hi>ſoule,</hi> which have thus <hi>ſerved</hi> them: which will make a fifth aggravation of a <hi>wicked</hi> mans <hi>miſery</hi> in being ſubject to theſe <hi>maſters,</hi> viz: becauſe their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are <hi>cruell,</hi> enjoyning him to doe, (not that from which ſome <hi>good</hi> or <hi>benefit</hi> may come, or which is <hi>indifferent,</hi> or which is onely <hi>weariſome</hi> and <hi>painefull,</hi> but) that which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>evill;</hi> abſolutely, and every way <hi>unprofitable</hi> in a <hi>ſpirituall ſenſe,</hi> and many times, and many wayes, in a <hi>carnall</hi> ſenſe; neceſſarily <hi>hurtfull,</hi> and <hi>deſtructive,</hi> not only to the <hi>body</hi> now (as in the ſins of <hi>whoredome, intemperance, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſſe</hi>) but both to <hi>body</hi> and <hi>ſoule hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. A <hi>wicked</hi> man hath many <hi>enemies.</hi> Even thoſe his <hi>maſters,</hi> are his <hi>enemies.</hi> What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition can be more ſad then his, who cannot <hi>fight</hi> with, but is <hi>under the command</hi> of his <hi>enemie?</hi> Eſpecially 1.

If it be a ſecret <hi>enemy,</hi> and a <hi>ſeeming freind.</hi> ſo theſe <hi>enemies,</hi> and <hi>maſters</hi> are: which makes them the <hi>eaſier</hi> to be believed, the <hi>harder</hi> to be <hi>avoided,</hi> and the <hi>worſe</hi> to be <hi>dealt</hi> with. Thoſe <hi>enemies</hi> are all in the <hi>darke</hi> to a <hi>wicked</hi> man; who walkes altogether in the <hi>darke,</hi> and hath noe light at all, either without him, or within him: and what advantage has my enemy, that ſtands neere me in the dark while I am in the light! A <hi>wicked</hi> man, being in darkneſſe, is no more able to deale with the <hi>divell</hi> (who is able to tranſforme himſelf into an Angell of <hi>Light</hi>) then a <hi>blinde</hi> man is able to fight with one that hath his ſight.</p>
            <p>But, beſide theſe that dwell within him, he hath other <hi>enemies</hi> without him that are not far from him neither. 1. <hi>God,</hi> who <hi>made</hi> him, is made his <hi>enemy:</hi> &amp; what an <hi>enemy</hi> muſt he be?

               <hi>godly;</hi> there is power enough with God: and he is certain to exerciſe it, firſt, or laſt, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of his children.</p>
            <p>What a <hi>poore</hi> love is it, that a <hi>wicked</hi> man hath! The <hi>godly</hi> man loves him, but does not love his <hi>company:</hi> the <hi>wicked</hi> man loves his <hi>company,</hi> but does not love <hi>him.</hi> He may love what he <hi>does</hi> (as <hi>drinking,</hi> and the like) becauſe he loves to do it himſelfe: but no longer then he <hi>does</hi> it, neither.

The <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> who beare him a grudge continually.

            <p>But what need I puzzle my head to ſearch, or weary my pen to ſhew you, how, and what <hi>occaſions</hi> a <hi>wicked</hi> man has to be <hi>ſorrowfull:</hi> when almoſt <hi>any object</hi> of <hi>any</hi> of his <hi>ſenſes,</hi> or his <hi>knowledge,</hi> is ſufficient to make him ſo? Not any thing that he <hi>ſees</hi> or <hi>heares,</hi> when he goes abroad: Not any thing that he <hi>eats,</hi> or <hi>drinks:</hi> Not any <hi>action</hi> that he does himſelfe, or knowes to be done by another: Not any <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent</hi> that befalls him: but, if it be not every way according to his mind, will marre all his mirth, if it were (or, if it <hi>ſeemd</hi> to be) never ſo much before.</p>
            <p>His <hi>mirth</hi> is ſuch; ſo <hi>carnall;</hi> ſo <hi>fraile;</hi> and ſo much <hi>depending</hi> upon the <hi>uſe,</hi> and <hi>enjoyment</hi> of <hi>outward things:</hi> that, unleſſe there be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall ſupply of ſuch <hi>oyle,</hi> it will quickly goe out in a ſtinking ſnuffe of ſorrow. Unleſſe there be a conſtant affluence of all thoſe things in a full current: if there be never ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:119702:185"/>
               <hi>amiſſe,</hi> or never ſo <hi>little intermiſſion,</hi> or never ſo little <hi>abatement</hi> of the <hi>water:</hi> his <hi>wheeles</hi> are preſently <hi>ſtopd,</hi> and he can goe no longer. Any <hi>change</hi> of any <hi>circumſtance,</hi> will change the <hi>mood</hi> (for a <hi>wicked</hi> man is but in a <hi>merry mood,</hi> at the beſt: never in a <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mind</hi>) Too ſoone, or too late: too faſt, or too ſlow: too oft, or too ſeldome: too long, or too ſhort: too much, or too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: any of theſe, or ſuch as theſe are, will doe it. His mirth is but <hi>ſtayd</hi> up by props, and thoſe very weak ones: So that having no <hi>root</hi> to hold it, any little puff of wind will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne it. Tis but <hi>ſuperficiall;</hi> without depth; but on the top of his face: Meere <hi>paint,</hi> no <hi>complexion. Heat</hi> will melt it, and <hi>water</hi> will waſh it, and any thing that agrees not with it, will deface, or take it away.</p>
            <p>To conclude, let a <hi>wicked</hi> man's <hi>condition</hi> be what it will, it is all one: for he is ſtill <hi>after the ſame manner,</hi> who is ſtill the <hi>ſame man.</hi> He hath enough <hi>within,</hi> to <hi>counterworke</hi> any thing that you ſhall bring from <hi>without.</hi> Uſe what inſtruments you will, <hi>cords,</hi> or <hi>forks; entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> or <hi>enforcements;</hi> a <hi>good,</hi> or a <hi>bad</hi> conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it is all one. His <hi>nature</hi> holds faſt: and his <hi>bad condition</hi> will continue ſtill, to breed him diſcontent enough. Come <hi>proſperity,</hi> or come <hi>adverſity;</hi> you ſhall ſee but little oddes for the better. One may make him more <hi>ſad</hi>
               <pb n="358" facs="tcp:119702:186"/>then the other: but neither will make him more <hi>merry. Adverſity</hi> may <hi>break</hi> his <hi>heart:</hi> and <hi>proſperity</hi> will not make it <hi>lighter.</hi> He has not the <hi>patience</hi> to <hi>endure</hi> the one: nor the <hi>diſcretion</hi> to <hi>manage</hi> the other, without vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. <hi>Adverſity</hi> is like a <hi>ſhield</hi> which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>beare:</hi> and ſo he muſt needs be <hi>overborne</hi> with it. <hi>Proſperity</hi> is like a <hi>ſword</hi> which he cannot <hi>weild:</hi> and a thouſand to one, but he <hi>hurts</hi> himſelfe with it (this <hi>ſword will enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> his <hi>owne heart Pſalm:</hi> 37.15.) His <hi>afflictions</hi> are <hi>intolerable,</hi> becauſe they are <hi>curſed</hi> of God, as he himſelfe is: they are ſent in <hi>diſpleaſure:</hi> and not ſo <hi>ſeldome</hi> neither, as men count, if we tooke better notice (but becauſe we think ſo well of good men, and ſee them puniſhed, we take notice of none but them.) <hi>How oft. is the candle of the wicked put out? And how oft cometh their deſtuction upon them? God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributeth ſorrowes in his anger. Job.</hi> 21.17. If their <hi>afflictions</hi> come not <hi>often,</hi> recompence is made in the <hi>coming.</hi> For they come with a vengeance. If his fall be but one, it is <hi>irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;</hi> for, <hi>He that is perverſe in his ways, ſhall fall at once, Prov:</hi> 28.18. When he is <hi>afflicted,</hi> none more <hi>afflicted</hi> then he. For he has no <hi>grace,</hi> either to <hi>endure</hi> his <hi>affliction;</hi> or to pray to be eaſed. On the contrary, the <hi>godly man,</hi> being well affected to God, and having God well affected to him; is ſo farre from being ſo

               <hi>ſadned</hi> and <hi>dejected</hi> either for being, or for <hi>feare</hi> of being afflicted: that he cannot only look upon, but <hi>laugh</hi> at afflictions. c. 5.22. <hi>At diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction and famine thou ſhalt laugh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One that lookes upon a <hi>godly</hi> man, and a <hi>wicked man</hi> with a <hi>carnall</hi> eye: nay, one that looks with a <hi>ſpirituall eye,</hi> but does not look <hi>neere enough,</hi> or <hi>long</hi> enough; will wonder there ſhould be ſo much <hi>difference,</hi> as there is, betweene them, in regard of their <hi>condition.</hi> But, I'le warrant you, let him look as he ſhould; and he will find it to be as I have ſaid.</p>
            <p>I will but ſhew you in a word or two, of what <hi>uſe</hi> that which I have ſaid, may be to the <hi>wicked</hi> man; and I have done. It is of uſe to him both for <hi>Information,</hi> and for <hi>Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>information,</hi> To informe him that he has been <hi>miſinform'd</hi> by the devill, and the world: who have put it into his head, that there is no life like that which he is in, for <hi>mirth;</hi> no <hi>mirth</hi> ſo good as his, and none ſo <hi>merry</hi> as he. 2. That his caſe is cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: viz: that no life has more <hi>cauſe</hi> of <hi>ſorrow</hi> then his; that no <hi>mirth</hi> is <hi>worſe</hi> either <hi>morally,</hi> or <hi>Phyſically,</hi> i.e. for <hi>corruption</hi> of <hi>ſinfullneſſe,</hi> or <hi>mixture</hi> of <hi>ſadneſſe:</hi> and that none is leſſe <hi>truly merry</hi> then he.</p>
            <pb n="560" facs="tcp:119702:187"/>
            <p>For <hi>exhortation,</hi> it will be of uſe to <hi>exhort</hi> him, That, ſeeing he hath ſo much <hi>cauſe</hi> to be <hi>ſorry,</hi> and his mirth is ſuch, what ever it <hi>ſeem</hi> to be: he would forbeare a while his <hi>fooliſh jolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and bethink himſelfe of the <hi>ſadneſſe</hi> of his <hi>condition,</hi> to <hi>get</hi> out of it; and the <hi>vanity</hi> of his <hi>mirth</hi> to <hi>leave</hi> it. Come, whoſoever thou art, doe not flatter thy ſelfe as other <hi>wicked</hi> men doe (as the pſalmiſt ſaid, <hi>He flattereth himſelfe in his owne eyes untill his iniquity be found to be hatefull, Pſalm:</hi> 36.2.) Doe not <hi>couzen</hi> thy ſelfe, to <hi>deceive</hi> the world. I tell thee, thou haſt many diſeaſes. Diſcover thy folly. Doe not conceale it: at leaſt, to him who will <hi>know</hi> it, though thou doeſt what thou <hi>canſt;</hi> and will <hi>forgive</hi> it, if thou doeſt what thou <hi>ſhouldſt.</hi> Doe not <hi>heale ſlightly</hi> thy <hi>wound:</hi> but ſearch thy ſins to <hi>the quick,</hi> and never leave, till they be <hi>dead.</hi> Thou haſt many a <hi>leake:</hi> and thou haſt a great deale of <hi>water</hi> in thee allrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
